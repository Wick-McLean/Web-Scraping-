To the Editor:
Don’t blame Donald Trump. He’s just a man who understands human emotions and is willing to do anything to exploit them for his benefit.
It’s human nature to want a leader to save us, especially when times are tough and events are confusing. We look for someone with simple answers to our complex problems. Unscrupulous individuals have always taken advantage of that need.
“Trumpism” is a just a new name for something that is not new. Benito Mussolini, the first successful fascist dictator of the 20th century, understood this very well. He used the fear of socialism, civil unrest, and the threat of violence to gain power. Sound familiar?
What do you know about the Mueller report? If you believe Trump was “totally exonerated,” you didn’t read the report. You believed what you were told about the report because it was what you wanted to believe.
Trump knew that if you read anything, it would be Bill Barr’s four-page summary, not the 700-plus page report and appendices, which did not exonerate Donald Trump.
He was not indicted for obstruction of justice for the reason that it is against Justice Department policy to indict a sitting president. In our system of “checks and balances” that would have placed too much power in a single department.
The Constitution places the power of impeachment and removal in the Congress. The fact that Congress failed to do that, does not mean he did not deserve it.
Did you watch the impeachment hearings? If you did, you know that Trump’s defenders spent all their time attacking the process without introducing a single shred of exculpatory evidence.
Plenty of evidence was introduced from credible witnesses to prove the charge of abuse of power. You think everyone under oath was lying except Donald Trump in his tweets?
When Bill Clinton was subpoenaed for a deposition under oath in the Paula Jones civil suit, at least he showed up. Donald Trump withheld documents and ordered witnesses not to appear.
Since he knows that a sitting president cannot be indicted for a federal crime while in office, Trump has an incentive to do everything he can to undermine trust in our election and try to stay in office.
Vladimir Putin is happy to help him again. If you are on social media, look forward to receiving bots from Russian troll farms that look like they come from credible American sources. If they stimulate fear and suspicion in your heart, it’s working.
The dying of America’s constitutional republic will be more like a suicide than a murder. The tragedy is that those committing the crime see themselves as patriots.
You might forgive them for not knowing what they do, but the result will be the same as if it were willful intent: the end of the balance of powers created in our Constitution, the rule of law, and the principal that no man is above it, not even a president.
If you want to find the truth, “follow the money.” Why do you think that Donald Trump has fought so hard not to do what other presidential candidates have done and made his tax returns public? Why doesn’t he want you to know where his money comes from?
A man who has nothing to fear, has nothing to hide. If you make excuses for him, you must fear the truth as much as he does.

There's been much talk among my fellow white Evangelical Christians about how President Donald Trump has been a "wake-up call" these painful, past four years. 
When are they going to answer that call?
An overwhelming majority of white Evangelicals instrumental in Trump's winning the White House in 2016, still insist the president is their man in 2020, according to a Pew Research Center poll earlier this month.
How long will white Evangelicals advocate for the leader of the free world who has all the character traits of an anti-Christ?
In Proverbs 6:16-19, it is written: "These six things the Lord hates, Yes seven are an abomination to him: A proud look, a lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that are swift in running to evil, A false witness who speaks lies, And one who sows discord among brethren."
Now that Trump's gross indifference and negligence has facilitated the deaths of approaching 225,000 people in America from COVID-19, the president arguably qualifies as guilty of each one of those abominations.
The facts are undeniable. While the coronavirus incubated death across the homeland, President Trump blew it off as inconsequential. He assured that the virus would just "go away," that it was "totally under control" and labeled it a "hoax" of Democrats.
"Let no man deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience," the Apostle Paul wrote in Ephesians 5:6.
A few verses later, Paul warned: "And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them."
In Proverbs 17:15, it is written: "He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the just, both of them alike are an abomination to the LORD."
In Mathew 10:16-17, Jesus instructed his Apostles to "be as wise as serpents, and harmless as doves" and to "beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves."
Yet, Trump and his abetting congressional Republican loyalists, in effect, are the ruthless ruling pigs in George Orwell's "Animal Farm" - disingenuously declaring equality for all, while hoarding all the milk and apples for themselves and treating the American people like a bunch of dim-witted barnyard animals.
When will we all get the "eyes to see," - as Isaiah and Jesus referenced - the vast, long-engrained economic inequalities and racial disparities in our country - which Republican policy long has fed and which the COVID-19 pandemic and George Floyd's merciless killing excruciatingly has laid bare.
Jesus Christ, in Matthew, commanded his followers to look out for the "least of these" - the hungry, the thirsty, the foreigner and the imprisoned.
While the right champions itself as "pro-life," it ignores the plight of literally millions of children who go to bed hungry in this nation, or the tens of thousands of poor citizens, mostly of color, who die prematurely because they lack adequate health care, or the millions more who are without jobs and health care due to the the coronavirus fallout.
Congressional hardliners from that same "pro-life" party rush through tax cuts for the richest, while opposing universal health care, maternity care and the raising of the national minimum wage so that a single mother wouldn't have to work two or three jobs at slave labor.
For decades now, Christians have been hoodwinked by the right to vote Republican without the "eyes to see" the devastation conservative policy has increasingly wrought upon the citizenry.
It's all come to a head under the leadership of a man with the moral compass of a garden snake. God's been calling, indeed, but nobody seems to be home.

Middle Township’s master plan is being reexamined by a committee that is made up entirely of the Planning Board, with no general public members allowed. According to Anthony Anzelone, chairperson, additional members slow the process down.  
At the January or February meeting, the Planning Board promised to keep the community up-to-date with their discussions on the proposed zone change contained in the plan that would ultimately allow a four-story hotel on a currently zoned “rural conservation” parcel.  
My neighbors and I had a chance to speak to the board at this time. We spoke about the inappropriate site for the hotel and the impact of road safety, along with noise and light pollution to the neighborhood.  
We tried to stress the negative environmental damage that would be done to this site and surrounding wetlands, but Anzelone wanted to hear nothing on this topic. He stated that was for the state Department of Environmental Protection to decide.  
Why would a group of professionals not want all information to make a sound decision on this matter? Pictures are worth a thousand words. Google an aerial view of this parcel. This parcel, our neighborhood and surrounding water, woods, and marshes do not even closely resemble the properties way over in town center, and it is certainly not adjacent to any similar commercial properties, as stated in the original request for the variance by the owners’ attorney, in March 2019.  
In fact, why would a group of investors buy this land in the first place if it was not properly zoned? If this zone is changed, as the board clearly wants to do, the property goes from being the most environmentally protected to the least protected, where anything goes.  
Back in 2014, the Environmental Commission recommended no zone change for the purpose of another construction project.  
Since COVID struck, many Planning Board meetings were canceled and those that were held were held via Zoom and consisted of variance applications.  
No mention of the master plan reexamination was listed until Sept. 8. The agenda item did not include the term “master plan,” as promised by Anzelone for clarity of future agendas.  
I have since learned that there was a discussion in September on this topic and that the proposed zone change was agreed upon by the board. I have requested the minutes from this meeting to verify this but have not received them.  
Now, after all this time, the board and Middle Township Committee want to rush this plan through by the end of the year. So many things in our lives have been delayed, disrupted, or postponed due to COVID-19 restrictions, but not this.  
When my neighbors and I tried to speak at the Planning Board meeting Oct. 13, we were not allowed, as it was only an “informal discussion.” We spoke at a previous meeting that was listed as “informal discussion,” so why not this meeting?  
The Oct. 22 Planning Board meeting was canceled, and the matter will be brought before the public for discussion and vote by the board Nov. 10 at the Middle Township Performing Arts Center. The public has only one opportunity for input after all this time and the board has apparently already made up their mind. 
My neighbors and I are not opposed to a hotel in Middle Township, which will bring more jobs to the local community. What we are opposed to is the proposed site.  
This is not NIMBY (not in my backyard). This is about preserving and protecting our natural resources, as well as our own township officials being responsible and doing the right thing by their community. To the Editor:

Voters in Cape May should vote out Chuck Lear and Patricia Hendricks. Vote for a $5 million firehouse. If need be, the police can stay where they are now, at City Hall and West Cape May. City Hall needs repair anyway, and an addition could be added over the sally port at the rear. 
Not only can we not afford it, there is another reason not to vote for the $15 million public safety building. That is its location with the new proposed library. 
Remember when Lear first ran for office, he proposed selling City Hall for condos, and building a parking garage in the City Hall parking lot?  
Remember when Lear and Hendricks got into office they tried to sneak redevelopment of the Acme-City Hall block first through the Cape May Planning Board and then, with Shaine Meier’s vote, through Cape May City Council, without voters even knowing what was happening?  
Folks found out and their plan was foiled, but later it turned out that one of Curtis Bashaw’s architect’s secret plans for the redevelopment was what Lear proposed when he was running for office: City Hall was to become “retail, condos” and City Hall’s parking lot was to become a parking garage, including where the firehouse stands. 
Then, not to be deterred, Lear, Hendricks, and Meier hired a redevelopment lawyer to try again, this time with another redevelopment zone at the Beach Theatre, too. 
Lear and Hendricks know that there is not anywhere near enough parking for a new public safety building and new library at City Hall. That’s why their new master plan proposes that precisely because of the new public safety building and library at City Hall, that the city should “promote redevelopment” in the Acme-City Hall block. Translated, this means more stores and a parking garage paid for by residents in this block.  
The master plan also recommends Lafayette and Washington streets become one-way streets to serve this commercial expansion. Imagine, in addition to your new future tax bills, how, if a parking garage were built in the Acme parking lot (justified by a public safety emergency – no place to park because of the new public safety building and the new library), life would be changed in Cape May, and not for the better. 
Now, instead of parking in the Acme parking lot to go to church, the Acme, the mall, funerals, City Hall, etc., we would have to go into and use a parking garage paid for by residents. 
How would this affect our National Historic Landmark District status? Would people still want so much to live in or visit Cape May? To the Editor:

What are we teaching our children? Children listen to everything that happens around them. They quietly, in most cases, absorb this information and employ it, as needed.  
They learn almost everything in this manner. Keeping this in mind, let’s look at what they’ve learned recently. 
Our children have been exposed to our current president’s lies by his own admission, regarding the lies he told all Americans publicly concerning this virus, while on TV.  
He said it was for our own good that we didn’t know the truth because we might be frightened. In the meantime, we’ve watched over 250,000 Americans die because they believed him. That’s frightening.  
Lesson number one: don’t lie. People who believe the lie might die because they believed you. That’s exactly what happened. They’ve also watched the death toll increase each day.  
Americans are generally not frightened of almost anything and they believed the lies he told on TV to all Americans because he was the president. This is the most serious lie because it has caused those people who believed in him to ignore the medical direction and information. 
During the last few days, our kids have been treated to new lies regarding a Supreme Court nominee. A woman judge was offered the nomination because her past rulings or decisions have indicated her preference and ability to demonstrate her authority, through the harsh decisions she’s made in the past, in a lower court.  
It’s also very interesting that she would accept this offer after the judge that has died has asked in her almost last breath that she not be replaced until a new president is chosen by the people and therefore her lifetime position on the court would also be chosen by the people and their choice of president. 
The likely reason for this appointment to the Supreme Court is that our president will probably question the outcome of the election if he loses and ask the court to rule on the results of this coming election.  
The presidency has always been a goal for our children, however, that’s no longer the case because of this current president. We seem to be teaching our children, through this president’s behavior, that all the horrible things that they witness on TV regarding his presidency are OK. They're not. God bless America.

 I am an eighth-grade student at Margaret Mace School, in North Wildwood.  
I would like to thank the entire Margaret Mace family for finding a way for the students to return to school full time and feel almost normal during these hard times.  
Everyone has worked together, from the cleaning staff to the teachers, to the administration and board of education.  
These may be difficult times, but we are working through it together, and we will be stronger for it. Thank you, Margaret Mace. To the Editor:

I'm writing this in response to a letter in the Oct. 21 Herald titled, "I'm Voting For..." 
The author states, in the first paragraph, that she is not voting for Trump, but for the First Amendment, and she goes on to list all the other reasons, including the Second Amendment, for our police to be respected, for the military and vets, for the continued support of Israel, and for a free country for her grandchildren. 
I understand that she is a Republican and probably has been for her entire life. I see all the reasons that she believes it is important for her to continue to vote Republican. 
I honestly can say that there are many of her reasons that I agree with. Certainly, the ones that I have listed above. 
There are exceptions, of course. I believe in my right to choose regarding my body. I am committed to my country and fly the American flag proudly in front of my home. 
I'm not a socialist nor a communist, and I would remind the author to look up Joseph McCarthy in 1950's America and all his abhorrent "communist" threats. It did not turn out too well then nor will it turn out any better in 2020.  
As far as judges and the Supreme Court, Republicans have had a field day for the last four years and, even as I write, will probably ram through another justice to the Supreme Court. 
I get how difficult it is now for Republicans in this altered universe we've lived in since 2016. Here's the thing, though. Saying you're not voting for Trump, but for all the reasons listed is sadly a lie because when you put the "x" next to Trump, you are voting for him.  
You're voting for a man who lied to us countless times in the last four years, who has separated children from their parents and over 400 parents can't be found for children in custody.  
You say you're voting for unborn babies. How about children? Are their lives less important because of the color of their skin? 
You're voting for a man who pays no taxes and continues to profit while the leader of our land. You're voting for a man who embarrassed our great country over and over again. He denigrates communist China while having a bank account there. 
He has zero empathy for the loss of young, Black lives and he continues to lie about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  
To the over 200,000 deaths from COVID-19, what do you say to their families about a leader who lied to the country because he didn't want us to panic? Really? 
The author thinks putting him in office for four more years will ensure all the reasons she listed in her letter. Sadly, the man has no plan for health care, to protect our environment, or to save countless more lives that will succumb to this pandemic. 
The Republican Party of today is not the GOP of John McCain, George H.W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan. Surely, you know that.  
It's why thousands of Republicans have already voted against him. They believe in the country first; and he will surely continue to destroy the Constitution, the rule of law, and the proud and honorable traditions of our beloved country. 
If you're attempting to save face by saying you're not voting for Trump, but for freedom of speech, etc., you're entering the dystopian country created four years ago. To the Editor:

I'm not a socialist nor a communist, and I would remind the author to look up Joseph McCarthy in 1950's America and all his abhorrent "communist" threats. It did not turn out too well then nor will it turn out any better in 2020.  
As far as judges and the Supreme Court, Republicans have had a field day for the last four years and, even as I write, will probably ram through another justice to the Supreme Court. 
I get how difficult it is now for Republicans in this altered universe we've lived in since 2016. Here's the thing, though. Saying you're not voting for Trump, but for all the reasons listed is sadly a lie because when you put the "x" next to Trump, you are voting for him.  
You're voting for a man who lied to us countless times in the last four years, who has separated children from their parents and over 400 parents can't be found for children in custody.  
You say you're voting for unborn babies. How about children? Are their lives less important because of the color of their skin? 
You're voting for a man who pays no taxes and continues to profit while the leader of our land. You're voting for a man who embarrassed our great country over and over again. He denigrates communist China while having a bank account there. 
He has zero empathy for the loss of young, Black lives and he continues to lie about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  
To the over 200,000 deaths from COVID-19, what do you say to their families about a leader who lied to the country because he didn't want us to panic? Really? 
The author thinks putting him in office for four more years will ensure all the reasons she listed in her letter. Sadly, the man has no plan for health care, to protect our environment, or to save countless more lives that will succumb to this pandemic. 
The Republican Party of today is not the GOP of John McCain, George H.W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan. Surely, you know that.  
It's why thousands of Republicans have already voted against him. They believe in the country first; and he will surely continue to destroy the Constitution, the rule of law, and the proud and honorable traditions of our beloved country. 
If you're attempting to save face by saying you're not voting for Trump, but for freedom of speech, etc., you're entering the dystopian country created four years ago. To the Editor: 
On several occasions in recent years, I have submitted letters to this paper, stating my concerns about the future of this nation. I have also stated my belief that we are approaching a second civil war. I must state that events of the last six months have only served to underscore the validity of those concerns.  
Never have I seen our nation so divided nor have I ever witnessed such hatred toward our fellow citizens, simply because we hold differing political ideologies.  
No longer do we "agree to disagree." I am personally seeing lifelong friendships end and family members not speaking because of political differences of opinion.  
I recently watched a news video where a young man was standing on a sidewalk, wearing a hat that supported a political candidate. The man was standing there, minding his own business.  
Another man wearing a shirt, which supported a different candidate, walked up and "sucker punched" the first man, knocking out his front teeth. They hadn't spoken a word before the attack.  
Apparently, based only on the fact that he wore a hat supporting a certain candidate, the man was brutally attacked. This is a scene that I see repeated far too often.  
Do we have any idea what we are doing to ourselves? Have we degenerated into a nation of anarchists who behave worse than animals?  
We disagree with something, so we take to the streets, smashing, burning, looting, beating, and, in some cases, killing people in the name of protest.  
I watched, as a reporter stood in front of a city block, as it burned to the ground only to report that this was a "mostly peaceful" protest. I have a real problem with that observation, as should everyone who saw that report.  
Go online and look up videos on the aftermath of the Minneapolis riots. I mean protests. These videos will show you blocks and blocks of the city that look like a war-torn Bosnia. This has been repeated in cities across the nation. 
I have been told many times that I preach "gloom and doom." Well, give me a reason to preach hope and optimism. I find none as I look to the future of our nation. We are, as a nation, committing suicide.  
No longer do our politicians state their platform and tell us why they believe it is the best course to take. Today, politicians engage in character assassination. If the only way a candidate must win my vote is by making his opponent look bad, he is not worthy of my vote or the office he is running for. 
I am sincerely concerned about our future. What are we teaching our children? What are we leaving for them? Certainly not the nation our fathers left for us.  
Regardless of your political affiliation, you should be equally as concerned. As one man once wrote, "You won't like what comes after America."  
This is an issue that is neither Democrat/Republican nor right/left. This is an issue of good vs. evil.  
We have allowed hatred to rise to the forefront and infiltrate our very nature and souls. No nation or people can survive as we have lived in recent months. It is not possible to continue in this fashion and survive. Sooner or later it will destroy us if we do not reverse this trend.  
As Scripture states, a house divided will surely fall. We need to call upon God to heal this nation, as well as our souls, relationships, and political agendas. If not, it will be doom and gloom. Count on it. To the Editor:

It's a good idea only if you believe in the "American dream" - our children should live at least as well as we do, and hopefully better - and only if you believe that we live in a competitive world, and we need to ensure that young Americans get a first-rate education to compete with young people in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. 
The American right-wing recognizes that educated people do not vote for the right-wing. The statistics are stark: Of the top 20 states rated by educational attainment, only the bottom two - Kansas and Georgia - are more or less reliably Republican.  
You can see this at the local level, as well. Cape May County ranks 14th in the quality of its public schools, and it's the most Republican county in the state. Coincidence? I think not.  
Of course, current and recent students, and their families, have been royally screwed by a fraudulent federal student loan system. It was designed by Republicans to make banks even richer at the cost of students and taxpayers.  
Herald readers should know that student loans are guaranteed by "the full faith and credit" of the U.S. government, so there is no way the banks can lose a penny on a student loan.  
Even so, rates charged for student loans are higher than those for loans that have no such guarantee, and to make things a whole lot worse, Republicans, including the current Secretary of Education Betsy Devos, blocked the government from helping students who have been bilked by fraudulent, for-profit "schools" to relieve them from their predatory creditors.  
I agree that university education in America is too expensive. Of course, tuition of $50,000 and more at private universities means the kids must come from rich families, or they must qualify for some kind of charity from the school or some other eleemosynary institution, or they have to take out obscenely expensive student loans, but public universities are also way out of the price range for a huge percentage of Americans: Wisconsin, $12,000 in-state, $38,000 out of state; Berkeley, $14,000 in-state, $44,000 out of state; University of Virginia, $18,000 in-state, $51,000 out of state; and Rutgers, $12,000 in-state, and $28,000 out of state.  
The phrase "world-envied system of private colleges and universities" simply has no validity. Nobody envies Americans paying upwards of $50,000 for a year at school.  
The simple fact is that in Europe (except the UK, of course) only rich students who cannot compete at a high level would even think of attending a private college or university. Just to give one example, tuition at the University of Paris, for undergraduates, is about $300 a year.   
How do they do that? One way is by focusing.  
European universities don't have football teams. They don't have glee clubs. They don't have rock-climbing walls. If students want to do such things, they find other places that offer them.  
Of course, another way is by paying taxes. Europeans pay higher taxes than we do. They get a whale of a lot more from them than we do, including cradle to grave health care, and, in the end, they pay a whale of a lot less for things like education and health care than we do, and what they get for their money is a whole lot better.  
To recite a common truism: You think education is expensive? Try ignorance.  
As Republicans fully recognize, their future is dependent on stopping people from getting educated. Their only hope is that ignorance and poverty mean more Republican votes. To the Editor:

Ever since the Clinton administration, I have understood that the people who run the Democrat Party are people who believe that character doesn’t count, the truth doesn’t matter, nothing is sacred, and only suckers obey the law.  
It is impossible to maintain a civil society based upon those beliefs. The society will ultimately deteriorate into what we are deteriorating into today - a tyranny with an unarmed citizenry.  
By holding those beliefs, the only way these people can govern is through the “compassionate” use of deception, oppression, coercion, and fear, i.e., Black Lives Matter, Antifa, etc.  
The following are just a few examples:  
A) “An exchange (redacted) discussing U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s approval of a plan concerning U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering U.S. elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.”  
The above is the heading of a recently released Central Intelligence Agency memo. The deep state has been hiding it for four years.  
It shows that the thoroughly corrupt Hillary Clinton, not President Trump, was the real colluder with the Russians during the 2016 election.  
As a result of those felonies, she and Obama became the driving force behind the cover-up of the worst political scandal in American history.  
With the help of the mainstream media, deep state, and left-wing lawyers, these people put our president, his family, and our country through hell for those four years. They never let up for one instant, because they refused to accept the results of the 2016 election.  
If they stop lying, they will be exposed as what they are. Here are just a few things they did: the endless contrived Mueller Report ($40 million, 500 interviews, and 2,500 subpoenas); endless hearings and subpoenas from Democrat-run Congressional committees; incessant lying (Schiff, only one of many); selective false leaks to a willing and hostile media; use of the intelligence agencies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) by Obama; entrenched bureaucrats and Obama holdovers; and an unconstitutional impeachment.  
B) To blame the president for the planned chaos and confusion that the Democrats and the media will inflict upon our country in the current election, Clinton publicly told Biden not to concede the election.  
This will give the 600 lawless, left-wing lawyers who have been hired by the Biden campaign more time to wreak havoc on and drag out the election process for as long as it takes to manufacture enough mail-in votes for Biden to win.  
They will make pious statements like “every vote must count” while at the same time they’ll be disenfranchising those of us who play by the rules.    
C) Speaking of playing by the rules, this is something you will not have heard if you only listen to “mainstream” media.  
We learned that members of the Biden family, the vice president included, have, since 2019, been under investigation by the FBI as part of a money-laundering operation.  
No wonder Biden has been hiding in his basement for weeks. He’s afraid he’ll get a question from a real journalist.  
These people hate our system of government, and they think we’re stupid. Do we really want lawless people like this controlling the futures of our children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nieces, and nephews? By the way, all lives matter. To the Editor:

The proposed hotel parcel and associated planning process have been far from transparent, with limited opportunity for engagement from the public impacted by the outcome.  
Information used by the Middle Township Planning Board has been challenging to access. Scheduled meetings during which public comments and questions were promised were canceled.  
Rather than delay this review until the COVID situation allows for improved collaboration, leadership appears to use the time to push through changes in the weeks ahead.  
Why is this such a sudden priority and for this particular location? Plenty of other township areas would better serve more adjacent local businesses (bars/restaurants, shopping, etc.).  
Moreover, the majority of establishments are along the Route 9 corridor and into Rio Grande. If this hotel is to truly serve as a "year-round" option for professionals and vacationers alike (especially for offices throughout the region), why wouldn’t a more centralized lot be targeted on the other side of the Garden State Parkway (GSP) and closer walking distance to restaurants?  
Job creation is certainly a community benefit, but why is leadership not looking at the broader, holistic picture and realizing there are better-suited locations to maximize patronage and growth for other local businesses.  
From an environmental standpoint, the 2010 plan put such emphasis on preservation, environment "and minimize development potential outside these centers."  
It appears that, in 2020, we’re forcing a change despite being directly adjacent to environmentally sensitive areas (the parcel is wooded wetlands subject to coastal flooding and encompasses natural heritage priority sites and cultural resources).  
Why, in a post-Superstorm Sandy era, is more stringent evaluation not conducted for developments adjacent to a Federal Emergency Management Agency special flood hazard area?  
This lot is along a flood zone; whereas, many other existing town center locations are not and would be wiser long-term choices. My hope would be that the township plan for and recommend resilient, lasting zoning.  
Have traffic implications, streets, and buffers been thoroughly considered? This hotel would increase vehicle traffic on an already precarious GSP on-ramp, not to mention a noisy lodging option for patrons so close to the thoroughfare without a tree line to insulate noise. I see future poor reviews/ratings due to noise and traffic that would be avoided with a different location.  
A Middle Township Committee member, when providing an opinion pertaining to a different parcel for commercial purposes, stated that they did not want to “spoil” the “flavor of the area.” Why wouldn’t a consistent standard be applied here?  
With regards to short-term rental authorization for residents to open their existing homes (Airbnb), there appears to be a significant reluctance to provide a recommendation to local leadership.  
Wouldn’t these types of rentals be an opportunity, in the absence of a major hotel, for local property owners to directly benefit and put those dollars immediately back into the local economy?  
There is a clear resident benefit here rather than generating revenue for an outside investment group (some members of which are not residents of the township). This all just doesn't add up.  
At the most recent committee meeting, I was assured that everything has been conducted in accordance with the law. I can't refute that. What I can say, however, is that this process has not been conducted in a collaborative nor transparent manner.  
Legality is the minimum threshold to measure by. Local committees have an obligation to proactively engage the communities on these decisions.  
I would ask that the community participate and voice your opinion at the next Planning Board meeting, scheduled for Nov. 10 at 7 p.m. (limited to the first 100 attendees). To the Editor:

Winter is coming, so now is the perfect time for New Jersey to take advantage of the benefits of energy efficiency.  
As we prepare for the cold months when people will be spending even more time at home and heating costs rise for businesses, energy efficiency programs can help consumers and business owners save on their monthly bills.  
Fortunately, Gov. Phil Murphy extended the utility shutoff moratorium, so no one has to worry about losing heat, power, or water altogether.  
Energy efficiency programs, such as whole-home weatherization, updated appliance efficiency standards, building electrification, and commercial property assessed clean energy are all ways to help businesses and consumers save money on their energy bills, while making progress on the state’s ambitious clean energy goals. 
However, we need action from our state leaders if we want any of this to be possible. Some of these solutions require legislative action and, most importantly, others need funding to make efficiency upgrades and retrofits accessible to the public. The Clean Energy Fund has seen cuts every year and was once again sacrificed for other programs in the 2021 state budget.   
Our state leaders must prioritize restoring the Clean Energy Fund and vote for policies that will protect consumers from high energy burdens into the future. It’s time to turn up the heat on energy efficiency in New Jersey.

A vote for Joe Biden is also a vote for Kamala Harris, who was recently named the most "liberal" senator in the U.S. Senate, even ahead of Bernie Sanders.  
Their agenda, if elected:  
* Pack the Supreme Court (if Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed) with at least four more justices (nine to 13) to ensure passage of their leftist progressive agenda.  
* Eliminate the Senate filibuster rule so that everything can pass with 51 votes.  
* Add two new states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, which would yield four new senators expected to be Democratic. 
* Pass "Medicare for all" which means government-run health care, with the elimination of employer paid health care, affecting 180 million Americans.  
* Pass a tax increase of trillions of dollars which will seriously negatively affect the economy. This will help pay for all the "free" things to come, such as health care for all illegal aliens (estimated to be anywhere from 11 to 22 million in the U.S.) and college for those who want it.  
* Eliminate the Trump tax cuts which will immediately cost all taxpayers thousands of dollars per year, even if earning less than $400,000 per year.  
* Restore all the regulations cut by Trump, e.g., offshore drilling. 
* Pass the "Green New Deal" which will eliminate millions of jobs in the energy industry by banning fossil fuels of all types, including oil, nuclear, coal, and, of course, fracking.  
* Reallocate funds from police budgets to other social programs (defund the police).  
* Eliminate the 2nd Amendment and confiscate all privately owned guns.  
Their goal is to remake America into a government-run country (a la Bernie Sanders' dream) because they know better than you do what is good and best for you. To the Editor:

* Pack the Supreme Court (if Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed) with at least four more justices (nine to 13) to ensure passage of their leftist progressive agenda.  
* Eliminate the Senate filibuster rule so that everything can pass with 51 votes.  
* Add two new states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, which would yield four new senators expected to be Democratic. 
* Pass "Medicare for all" which means government-run health care, with the elimination of employer paid health care, affecting 180 million Americans.  
* Pass a tax increase of trillions of dollars which will seriously negatively affect the economy. This will help pay for all the "free" things to come, such as health care for all illegal aliens (estimated to be anywhere from 11 to 22 million in the U.S.) and college for those who want it.  
* Eliminate the Trump tax cuts which will immediately cost all taxpayers thousands of dollars per year, even if earning less than $400,000 per year.  
* Restore all the regulations cut by Trump, e.g., offshore drilling. 
* Pass the "Green New Deal" which will eliminate millions of jobs in the energy industry by banning fossil fuels of all types, including oil, nuclear, coal, and, of course, fracking.  
* Reallocate funds from police budgets to other social programs (defund the police).  
* Eliminate the 2nd Amendment and confiscate all privately owned guns.  
Their goal is to remake America into a government-run country (a la Bernie Sanders' dream) because they know better than you do what is good and best for you. In January, before COVID-19 made its presence known in the Garden State, Gov. Phil Murphy signed Executive Order 100 “directing sweeping regulatory reform to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change.” 
In the title of the executive order, Murphy tells us several things. 
First, he tells us that the “regulatory reforms” are being done only on his executive say so. There will be no legislative give and take. These changes will not be enacted as part of any legislative package. 
Next, he characterizes them as “sweeping.” The changes will not be tweaks of existing regulations, rather they will involve a significant change in the way the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) engages in the permitting process that already represents a significant burden, in time and money, on public and private projects, especially in coastal regions of the state. 
Lastly, Murphy ties the changes in regulation to the broad issue of climate change providing the link to the state’s energy master plan, a signature effort of his administration, and, in his own words, nothing less than “a complete transformation of our energy policy.” 
Soon after the issuing of the executive order, the pandemic made its appearance in the state, shifting attention to the immediate threat posed by rapidly growing COVID-19 infections.  
Communities, including Cape May County, did not focus sufficiently on the impact of the governor’s push for regulatory reform and what those reforms are likely to do to important county infrastructure needs. 
Citing a Rutgers University study on the state’s vulnerability to climate change and rising sea levels, Murphy said he is drawing “a line in the sand against climate change” by directing the reform of New Jersey’s land use regulations to incorporate climate change considerations into the DEP permitting process. 
The executive order also calls for establishing a greenhouse gas monitoring program and for adopting new regulations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and other air pollutants. 
Many environmental groups lauded the governor’s action. Some business groups expressed concern over the unknown costs to ratepayers and businesses. 
At issue, as well, should be the method the governor used in taking such sweeping steps without public debate, in the absence of responsible impact studies that provide insight into probable costs, and with no analysis of the likely influence of the changes on infrastructure projects. This is the wrong way to generate public support in advance of a sizeable public burden. 
Here, in Cape May County, we can anticipate the impact to mean serious delays and added expense for important infrastructure projects that will now be subject to new analysis concerning the influence of construction on climate change. 
The Cape May County bridge replacement and rehabilitation plan was recently issued, generating expressions of public support for a long over-do and essential effort. Bridge replacement and rehabilitation are essential if we hope to maintain an infrastructure appropriate to the millions of visitors who are at the heart of our economy. 
An additional overlay of climate change impact analysis, along with modifications necessary to satisfy new regulatory requirements, can only prolong what is already a 15-year plan for the bridges. 
Another area of concern is the extension of Route 55, the final 20 miles from Port Elizabeth to Court House. We have long argued the importance of the Route 55 extension in terms of the economic development of the county. 
Safety concerns have also been at the forefront of the case for extending the roadway. The peninsula that is Cape May County plays host to hundreds of thousands of people on any given day during the summer. A need to evacuate in advance of a dangerous storm would result in a process that the existing road infrastructure can't accommodate. 
We admit that the extension of Route 55 has been a project in limbo due to stated “environmental concerns.” Ironically, the regulations likely to be a product of climate change considerations will make reviving the project harder just as actual climate change and the increase in severe storm activity makes an evacuation route ever more critical. 
The regulatory reform ordered by the governor is underway, but the public has seen none of it yet. By the time the mandatory public hearings are held, most of the proposed changes will be embedded in cement that is drying as the public speaks. 
We can't gauge the depth of our concern because we have not yet been involved in the details of the regulatory reform underway, or even in the goal-setting that preceded it. This is the danger of sweeping change via executive order. The public is left to fear what it has not yet seen. I know the church has been getting a poor rep lately.  
Lately, it seems everyone has an opinion, and not all of them are positive. This pandemic has been more about division than bringing people together, which is a shame.  
Some think the church should meet, and others believe the wisest move is to stay apart. Many vote for masks on, and just as many who say masks off. Some want us to meet only outside, and others can’t understand why everything isn’t inside.  
At The Lighthouse Church, we have done our best to provide entry points that cover the bases by offering four worship services every weekend, but even that has not satisfied the masses. At a time when the church needs to be staying together, there are too many attempts to tear it apart. 
The church is not an organization; it is a living organism. The church is not made of a workforce; it is made of God's family showing the world how it is done.  
No matter what, programs will never give us what only God’s power can provide. Big budgets don’t promise the Holy Spirit has the freedom to move. Flashy worship may be entertaining, but if the music showcases the band over the One we should be singing to, there will be a short circuit in the electricity department.  
We need to let our light shine, so people can see Jesus whether they know the pastor’s name or not. God-initiated vision prevents believers from looking in the wrong direction with prioritizing their most important purpose. I believe the Bible tells us that it has to do with love. 
In the Gospel of John, 13:34-35, Jesus told us, “A new commandment, I give to you, that you love one another: Just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this, all people will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another.” 
Loving God will only strengthen our relationship with Him because we learn that He loved us before we loved Him. The more we allow God’s love to invade our hearts, the more we will begin caring for those around us.  
This world is about taking “selfies.” The church should be about making “otheries” more important than our desires. Humans stand on level ground before the cross of Christ. Young and old, male and female, Jew and Gentile, rich and poor, black, white, and every other nationality that has ever walked the grounds of this planet, we are sinners needing salvation. 
This is not the season that we should be about barriers. Why are we constructing walls that our Lord and Savior already tore down? Only by living Jesus' love and genuinely loving one another will the world ever see the real Jesus.  
It is to brothers and sisters that the world is drawn. The church is the bride of Jesus. Are we attempting to be more factory than family?  
Actions always speak louder than words. For God so loved the world that He gave us Jesus, and in Jesus, we should finally discover the value of being around one another. 
God made it obvious that without the church, there would be no Christianity.  
Too much of a believer’s spiritual formation must occur primarily within the context of community, where people mature in their faith. There are so many goals you can’t accomplish as a solo entity. How can you do all the “one another's” of Scripture if there is nobody around you for practicing?  
People who stay committed to Jesus' truths will experience what God has in store for His creation. We must learn to work through conflict, practice holiness partnered with hospitality, forge through forgiveness, fight the great fight of faith, and stick it out when running away might be the easiest option. 
I have always said that I would rather have pew jumpers than church hoppers. I love seeing God’s people practice his word. 
In my 24 years in Cape May County, I have seen many people come and go, come again and go again, and so on. We all know people who are critical of the church. Unfortunately, they are not committed enough to be part of the spiritually led solutions.  
Aren’t you glad that Jesus doesn’t give up on us? He wants us to blossom where we were planted, but there will be no eternal fruit if faith doesn’t dig deep roots. Like trees repeatedly transplanted from soil to soil have a challenge to establish a real root system, so are Christians who don’t dig in and make a lasting statement about who they are and what they believe. 
You can’t ignore the church's importance. Nobody is perfect, and there is no infallible place of worship this side of heaven. Wherever we go, flesh will always attempt to squash faith. The enemy comes to steal, kill and destroy.  
God promised that His explosion of colorful creativity would be displayed through the church. Not everything is black and white. 
There is unity around the truth, but there is diversity in how faith is expressed. What a time for the watching world to see the church at its best. This is the day that God wants us to become the rock that He proclaimed hell's gates won't stand against. 
I love being a pastor because it keeps me real. Traveling speakers can repeat their five best messages, coming to town only to leave just as fast. However, when the shepherd makes his home in the middle of the sheep, you can’t fake it because you will be exposed quite quickly.  
The church is God’s idea, so I wouldn’t abandon it too quickly. God didn’t commission the angels to share the great news of Jesus. He gave His Holy Spirit to redeemed men and women.  
Instead of opting out, it is time for us to surrender all to our Savior who gave us nothing less than His best. Get excited and let’s uplift Jesus.  
It is not about denominations or political parties. It is about believing in the Lord, Jesus Christ, and allowing Him to shine through us.  
Our world is becoming too dark, and now, more than ever, it is a season for the church to shine. Come be part of what God is doing. It is a miraculous adventure.  
Let’s stop going to church, and instead, let’s be the church.

As a practicing psychotherapist, in New Jersey, I have professional experience with the increasing mental health needs in our community due especially to COVID-19. 
I see, firsthand, clients with and without previous mental health issues carrying a heavy emotional burden, leading to anxiety, stress, depression, and suicidal thoughts. 
The Aug. 13 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey report on COVID-19 and mental health showed symptoms of anxiety and depression much higher than last year, plus an increase in substance abuse. Also, one in four young adults has considered suicide during this pandemic. 
In times of crisis like this, we need strong leadership that recognizes the importance of addressing mental health and substance abuse needs in our communities. 
Amy Kennedy, as the potential representative for the 2nd Congressional District, has already put forward a comprehensive plan "for revolutionizing mental health and substance abuse treatment in the U.S." 
Personally, and professionally, I like her platform, which states she will fight to provide emergency funding for mental health and substance abuse treatment and expand telemedicine, as well as suicide prevention services.

I want to remind you of a foundational piece of biblical truth, which is, “The Lord has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all” (Psalm 103:19).  
Simply put, the Lord rules over every earthly rule and ruler. From the rise and fall of kings and kingdoms, God is sovereign over all. We should find that truth comforting. 
However, part of His ruling over all is Him giving man over to his own rule, and this is where we get the idea behind free will.  
Man’s prerogative is to accept or reject God’s rule, and sadly, when we see man choosing his own plan, we see the devastation that follows. This willful rebellion against God is human history's pattern. It is the basis of progressivism or progressive thought, where humans believe they can flourish apart from their Creator and His standard (Romans 1:20-25). 
As a result, progressive thought driven by a degenerate heart (fallen man) produces a rebellious onslaught, but as believers, we must not lose hope despite perceived hopelessness around us. Because although “the enemy shall come in, like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him” (Isaiah 59:19). That standard is Christ being lifted up (John 12:32).  
You may not be aware, but amid the lawlessness and madness in 2020, there has been an equally active revival across the country. 
Christ's standard has been uplifted in the mayhem of hopelessness, and it is through the standard that in Christ we stand. As Christians, our identity and integrity are infused by Christ, not our color, class or culture. Scripture is clear, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28). 
Let’s not choose sides, but rather, let’s be on the Lord’s side. When we recognize that a war is raging in the spiritual realm, we will begin to contend for the truth. This war is not won by ballots or bullets, but instead by biblical boldness.  
There is nothing casual about Christianity. Casual Christians will become casualties, so let us fight by allowing God's word to be our battle cry. Let us choose Christ as the standard lifted up and lived out.

Locking my eyes to hers, I asked Kelly a question she dreaded answering: “How lonely do you feel in this marriage?”  
I wanted to be pleasantly surprised that her and Karl enjoyed a deep connection they deserved.  
Karl is a bright-eyed, tawny-haired man, well-built and carefully dressed. His ready smile and wit helped him win others over. 
Kelly looked at me as she whispered, "very." She and Karl returned to couples’ therapy they began 22 years ago to pull off a wedding after three false starts.  
In a busy life of children and dual careers, there was precious time and funding for continued therapy. The marriage squeaked by but was vulnerable to encroachment. A female colleague of Karl’s acted as a catalyst, warning him that he was about to stray deeply, and he caught himself.  
“Judith, I am in serious trouble here. Can you help?” I hoped I could. 
A couple’s therapist needs to be the marriage's fan while also rooting for each partner. Although it is natural to feel tender towards a victim, I was too well trained to believe Kelly was faultless in this marital disaster. I remembered her tendency to avoid tough psychological situations and create literal and figurative costumes. 
Ours is the story of how to transform a marriage from tortured to delightful through couples' group therapy, where I am equipped to work with couples through a half-century of successful marriages with two terrific men. 
Loneliness has assumed epidemic proportions that damage millions of children, adolescents and adults.  
An American Psychological Association study of 20,000 adults (August 2018) found that loneliness has increased to the point that it can lead to earlier death from multiple causes, according to Juliann holt Lunstad, psychology professor, Brigham Young, who is also a central researcher on loneliness. The internal experience of disconnection or rejection hides in marriages that look “just fine,” hiding and being taken for granted as part of our busy lives. 
Marriage is supposed to provide an intimate connection. When it fails, it creates the deepest human craving. I am certain there is nothing lonelier than a lonely marriage.  
I treat those who live in, what they feared was, a terminal lonely marriage. I treat them, and together, we can change the outcome.  
My husband, John, the master renovator of our compound of historic waterfront cottages, near Cape May, has an armament of tools purchased over decades to take the cottages down to their 1929 studs. Selecting the right tool, he designs space, installing massive triangles of glass under sloping roofs, creating light-filled rooms that invite lounging and gazing at the channel rushing by in its need to join the larger bay nearby.  
Like John, I renovate, but I renovate intimacy broken down by ignorance of how to couple skillfully. My tools have been purchased from my colleagues’ excepts in developing our current armament of expertise to help turn disaster into intimate delights. 
I regularly review the research on loneliness and intimacy. From this knowledge, I have concocted seven simple-to-learn but hard-to-practice intimacy skills.  
Like researcher John Cacioppo, from the University of Chicago, I distinguish between solitude, the need to be alone to know myself deeply, and the chasm of emptiness I felt after my first husband died suddenly of cancer, at age 49.  
The solitude of writing these pages for you offers me peaceful and restorative time to replenish my reserves and remind me why I need to spend time alone. Research on loneliness (LeRoy) confirms what my innards and those of my clients tell us.  
Subjective loneliness is an epidemic stemming from how lonely a person feels, regardless of how many people surround them. Lonely people suffer a greater risk of illnesses, such as cognitive decline (dementia and Alzheimer’s) depression, and viruses creating havoc in wellbeing. Cacioppo defines loneliness as a “debilitating psychological condition” that accompanies a sense of emptiness, worthlessness, lack of control, and personal threat.

Kelly looked at me as she whispered, "very." She and Karl returned to couples’ therapy they began 22 years ago to pull off a wedding after three false starts.  
In a busy life of children and dual careers, there was precious time and funding for continued therapy. The marriage squeaked by but was vulnerable to encroachment. A female colleague of Karl’s acted as a catalyst, warning him that he was about to stray deeply, and he caught himself.  
“Judith, I am in serious trouble here. Can you help?” I hoped I could. 
A couple’s therapist needs to be the marriage's fan while also rooting for each partner. Although it is natural to feel tender towards a victim, I was too well trained to believe Kelly was faultless in this marital disaster. I remembered her tendency to avoid tough psychological situations and create literal and figurative costumes. 
Ours is the story of how to transform a marriage from tortured to delightful through couples' group therapy, where I am equipped to work with couples through a half-century of successful marriages with two terrific men. 
Loneliness has assumed epidemic proportions that damage millions of children, adolescents and adults.  
An American Psychological Association study of 20,000 adults (August 2018) found that loneliness has increased to the point that it can lead to earlier death from multiple causes, according to Juliann holt Lunstad, psychology professor, Brigham Young, who is also a central researcher on loneliness. The internal experience of disconnection or rejection hides in marriages that look “just fine,” hiding and being taken for granted as part of our busy lives. 
Marriage is supposed to provide an intimate connection. When it fails, it creates the deepest human craving. I am certain there is nothing lonelier than a lonely marriage.  
I treat those who live in, what they feared was, a terminal lonely marriage. I treat them, and together, we can change the outcome.  
My husband, John, the master renovator of our compound of historic waterfront cottages, near Cape May, has an armament of tools purchased over decades to take the cottages down to their 1929 studs. Selecting the right tool, he designs space, installing massive triangles of glass under sloping roofs, creating light-filled rooms that invite lounging and gazing at the channel rushing by in its need to join the larger bay nearby.  
Like John, I renovate, but I renovate intimacy broken down by ignorance of how to couple skillfully. My tools have been purchased from my colleagues’ excepts in developing our current armament of expertise to help turn disaster into intimate delights. 
I regularly review the research on loneliness and intimacy. From this knowledge, I have concocted seven simple-to-learn but hard-to-practice intimacy skills.  
Like researcher John Cacioppo, from the University of Chicago, I distinguish between solitude, the need to be alone to know myself deeply, and the chasm of emptiness I felt after my first husband died suddenly of cancer, at age 49.  
The solitude of writing these pages for you offers me peaceful and restorative time to replenish my reserves and remind me why I need to spend time alone. Research on loneliness (LeRoy) confirms what my innards and those of my clients tell us.  
Subjective loneliness is an epidemic stemming from how lonely a person feels, regardless of how many people surround them. Lonely people suffer a greater risk of illnesses, such as cognitive decline (dementia and Alzheimer’s) depression, and viruses creating havoc in wellbeing. Cacioppo defines loneliness as a “debilitating psychological condition” that accompanies a sense of emptiness, worthlessness, lack of control, and personal threat.

I am fascinated by the paths our favorite songs took to reach the public forum. Let’s say that passion is born out of pain.  
God has turned our trash into treasures. Many beautiful melodies were produced from being battered. Creation proves that not everything done in the dark has to remain there.  
When I felt my heart was shattered into pieces, God gave me a song. How many of us are surviving because we have learned how to sing when we felt like sinking into oblivion? One such horror story became a hymn of great inspiration.  
It happened to a man named Joseph Scriven. In 1842, just before my time, this Irishman graduated from Trinity College, in Dublin, and like so many other young men before him, he fell head over heels in love with a girl from his neighborhood. 
They got engaged, planned their wedding, and began dreaming about the future that they would experience together, as husband and wife, but tragedy invaded their tomorrows.  
During the night before their wedding, Joseph’s fiancée saddled a horse to visit him. It would turn out to be one of the last things she would do. 
Joseph saw his wife-to-be riding toward him, and he couldn’t wait to kiss her, but suddenly, as she was crossing a bridge, her horse bucked and threw her like a ragdoll into the river below.  
Joseph ran with everything he had, jumping wildly into the river and calling her name. He soared deep into its icy waters, but his efforts would not help.  
By the time he got to her, the woman he loved was dead. He thought that he would be going to a wedding but ended up at a funeral. 
If that wasn’t enough to steal the breath from his faith, Joseph moved to Canada. While there, he fell in love again.  
In 1854, Joseph and Eliza Roche planned to become husband and wife. The wedding had to continually be put off because Eliza was ill, and even with all the hope and prayers on her behalf, she became worse and eventually died, too. 
Joseph Scriven was never married. His mother was deeply concerned for her heartbroken son, but his faith was established and unsinkable. It wasn’t his mother that exalted him.  
Joseph composed a poem to strengthen her, knowing little that it would become one of the most-loved songs. Several years later, a friend found it in a drawer at Joseph’s house and was touched. 
“The Lord and I wrote it together,” Joseph explained. That poem, forged from so much disappointment and pain, continues to make believers look up when they probably feel like giving up. 
“What a friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear," the song says. "What a privilege to carry - everything to God in prayer. O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear, all because we do not carry - everything to God in prayer. 
"Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged - Take it to the Lord in prayer. Can we find a friend so faithful, Who will all our sorrows share? Jesus knows our every weakness - Take it to the Lord in prayer.” 
As I write this, I want to pray for all of us. I believe this is no time for us to continue to be held hostage by the fear of what might be.  
God has shown up to equip us for what is. When Scripture uses the word comfort, it doesn’t mean what we think it does in English.  
It is not so much about how a mother holds a crying baby to her chest as it is God properly preparing us for the ride of our lives. When Christians are begging for a pillow and blanket, perhaps we should be looking for a crash helmet and a new pair of Nikes. 
The problem with America’s church today is we waste too much time thinking God is going to fix what is unpleasant when we should be planning for our next adventure. The Lord wants to work in us more than He wants to change the stuff around us.  
Jesus is looking to get us ready for the challenges still to come. We can’t settle for anything less than following our Savior the entire way that He leads, even if it means a bumpy ride. 
Are we pretending that the kiddie rides are the safe option when we might need to fasten our seatbelts for the roller coaster with the twists and turns that make our stomach queasy? Can we escape so great a calling by playing it safe when we know that to live means to risk great pain and heartaches?  
If we don’t need Jesus, we won’t trust Him. If we are fooling ourselves by thinking that the little boat ride in a safe circle is the journey Jesus has invited us to, we will be sadly mistaken and spiritually off track.  
Getting our heart crushed is nobody's idea of a picnic, but the reality is that without a willingness to surrender our way to God’s will, we might never learn to sing the sweet song of salvation. If our walk contradicts our words, we lose our testimony. Our “walk” and our “talk” must agree. 
A yielded heart is necessary for this sinner to be made into a saint. Too many Christians today emphasize guarding the truth, but they sadly downplay living the truth.  
One of the best ways to guard the truth is to live by what we believe. It is important the faith's defenders, but we must not forget to be its demonstrators.  
Joseph articulated his union with Jesus because it stood the test of how living on this planet can wreak havoc in your heart.  
Stop only singing praise tunes. Jesus' followers should be writing new verses to expound upon how being connected to God is life and doesn't simply fix it.

ED. NOTE: The author is the senior pastor of The Lighthouse Church, 1248 Route 9 South, Court House. A bill is making its way through the legislature in Trenton. On October 8 it was advanced out of the Assembly Higher Education Committee. The bill would make permanent the Community College Opportunity Grant (CCOG) program that has been piloted since the spring of 2019. The bill’s sponsors say that rising costs have put college out of reach for many students. They argue that the CCOG “closes the gap for middle and low-income students.” 
The grant is known as a last-dollar grant, meaning that students must have already applied for all appropriate state and federal grants they may be eligible for. The CCOG then provides the remaining funds to cover tuition and approved fees. The sponsors say that the program has already proven itself a success. Their purpose with this bill is to take the pilot program and “enshrine it into state law so it may benefit future generations.” 
The program falls under the rubric of a larger goal that has gained momentum in some circles, to make public higher education free by transforming it into a fully publicly supported endeavor. It is an idea that has percolated through the Democratic Party since Senator Bernie Sanders called for free college and the canceling of student debt in 2015.  
A simplified version of the argument goes something like this. College is essential in modern America. It is the “ticket” to a middle-class life. Rising costs have put higher education beyond the reach of many low-income students.  It has also saddled tens of millions of students with an accumulated $1.5 trillion dollars in debt from student loans. The country needs a college educated workforce to keep us competitive with other post-industrial economies. The solution is to increase the public obligation for education from K-12 to K-14 or even K-16.  
Aside from what this might do to our richly diverse and world-envied system of private colleges and universities, the concept fails the most basic of tests.  It does not address the problem it purports to solve. Programs like the CCOG do nothing to address the rising costs of higher education, they merely shift the burden of who pays those costs. 
We have been warned repeatedly about the unintended consequences of putting more public funds at risk. We just don’t want to listen. 
In 1987 Secretary of Education William Bennett took to the opinion pages of the New York Times to argue that increases in financial aid are met by increases in tuition, shifting the benefits of the new aid from the student to the higher education institutions. He hypothesized that more aid does nothing to increase college affordability. 
Bennett was a conservative politician serving in the Reagan Administration and many on the left dismissed his arguments.  
A less easily dismissed source for the argument of unintended consequences came from a staff report from the New York Federal Reserve. The analysis in that report showed that the average tuition and fee increase associated with an expansion of student financial aid is $0.65 on the dollar. The vast majority of the expanded aid went onto the coffers of the institutions in the form of higher prices. 
The slippery slope of free college, begun here with attempts to make community colleges free to those with incomes below proscribed levels, could potentially result in the same steady increases in higher education spending, and by extension prices.   
The problem of higher education costs, and by association affordability, will not be solved by avoiding the key issue, the cost structure of modern higher education. Ballooning service costs, larger administrative staffs, funds going into the competition for enrollments rather than actual instruction, all lead to growth in spending and prices. 
 Adding more public funds to meet these rising costs also ignores long-standing problems that have not been resolved even with regular tuition increases.  
We have major problems of college readiness with evidence that around 60% of students entering community colleges are faced with remediation. Even in four-year, more selective environments, national figures show 37% of entering students taking an average of 2 remedial courses.  
The Community College Research Center at Teacher’s College Columbia University did a study that showed ACCUPLACER, the most commonly used test for placing students entering community colleges, “severely misplaces 33% of entering community college students,” both by placing some in remediation who did not need it and by passing students on to college level credit courses who are truly unprepared. 
We know from other studies that vocational certificates are associated with higher earnings in the workplace, but we undermine the attractiveness of such programs, vocalizing loudly about the need for a traditional college education. The largest major in state community colleges is “general studies,” hardly addressing skills valuable in the workplace. 
Community colleges are seen as the affordable pathway to a four-year degree. Another CCRC study showed that 81% of students who enter a community college articulate a desire for a four-year degree. Yet only 33% of entering students successfully transfer to a four-year institution. Of those, 42% complete a bachelor’s degree in 6 years. The math works out to 14% of entering students achieving the four-year degree they aspired to.    
Many problems need fixing and a strategy to accomplish this must be far more sophisticated than providing more public money for tuition. 
We know little about the success rate of the pilot CCOG program. The argument has been made solely on the basis of access not outcomes. We know that the program has increased enrollments at community colleges that have been experiencing enrollment declines. That is a success for the institution, not a guarantee of success for the student. 
The idea that we decry the out of control spending and price increases in higher education and then address the issue by adding more public money to the mix is not intuitively a good one.  
We need a public discussion on the future of our tiered system of higher education, its intimate relationship to secondary education and the crucial role it should play in ensuring that employers have access to a strong, local and appropriately trained workforce. 
State officials should not be so ready to hand over additional public funds until we know exactly what it is we are buying. To the Editor:

The fires in the West continue to burn, and smoke is still reaching us, in New Jersey. We can't directly prevent these fires, but we can reduce our air and climate pollutants.  
The American Lung Association (ALA) recently released a report, “Road to Clean Air,” documenting the public health impact of electrifying our transportation sector.   
The report highlights the importance of reaching the clean cars mandate of 330,000 electric vehicles (EVs) on New Jersey roads by 2025, which became law, in January. The ALA estimates that New Jersey could save nearly $2 billion, in health costs, in 2050 by electrifying our transportation sector.  
We still have work to do to meet the EV bill mandate by 2025. To ramp up the adoption of EVs, getting more drivers behind the wheel is imperative.  
Consumer Reports wrote that EV drivers spend 50% less than gas car owners on maintenance and repair, but the rebate of up to $5,000 is still necessary to spark new purchases of EVs.  
Thankfully, Gov. Murphy ensured the full EV rebate funding was protected in the fiscal year 2021 budget. Electrification is one of the best things we can do to clean our air and reduce climate pollutants.

Democrats are not hiding what they are going to do if elected. This is my opinion of their policies. 
Higher taxes - To pay for all the free things: health care, college, child care, even for citizens/non-citizens who are not working and don’t pay taxes. 
Open borders - Anyone can come into the U.S. without being checked (gang members, sex traffickers, communists, terrorists). Remember 9-11? I do. Abolishing border patrol, which will leave our borders wide open for any criminals and terrorists. How do you think that will work for us? 
Defunding police - How safe do you think the streets will be for your family and who are you going to call in an emergency - social workers? You might as well call ghostbusters. 
“No Bail” policy - Someone is arrested for whatever crime, including rape, assault, robbery, and murder, and they get out on bail to commit crimes. This has already happened on more than two occasions and that is documented. 
Abolishing gas, oil, and so forth - Loss of millions of jobs, no planes, no boats, only electric cars. Do you realize the price of vehicles when you have no choice? Houses, business, and buildings will have to convert from fuel (imagine the cost of that). There will be long road trips where you have to keep stopping to recharge your car. We can't correct climate change by ourselves. The world would have to participate. The rain forest is not being destroyed by climate change. It is being destroyed due to humans cutting down trees to produce wood for building homes for the increasing population. That was a documentary on TV. Maybe everybody should’ve watched it. It would open your eyes. 
Higher taxes on businesses - The Democrats have already done this in the past (and they are saying they will do it again), causing outsourcing of American jobs and raising taxes on businesses, which forces businesses to leave the U.S. 
Freedom of speech - They are also, as of right now, and they aren’t in office yet, restricting our freedom of speech. By the way, at the Democratic convention, they left out two words of the Pledge of Allegiance - “under God.” That should tell you everything. 
Health care - Amy Kennedy may be a very nice person, but if elected she will have no choice but to become radical and vote along with the rest of the Democrats, whether she wants to or not or face the backlash, just like Van Drew (why do you think he changed his party?), and if you think she will be able to do anything about health care, think again. All the Democrats want is Medicare for all (how long do you think Medicare can survive?) or the Affordable Care Act, which is expensive, and my doctors bailed out. I know. I was on it. It is cheaper to pay the tax penalty than to pay for health care.  
Democrats will reverse the deal that the president made with Iran. Our tax dollars will, again, be given to Iran. They will, again, be able to advance their nuclear weapons, which they would love to use against the U.S. Do you want America to be at the mercy of Iran and Communist China? 
This is just a handful of what they are openly stating they will do. They are not hiding anything. Is this the America you want? Think about it. Wake up, America, before it's too late.To the Editor:

I am against abortion and would love for abortion on demand to end, but there are several other problems that can't be ignored. I am against racism and white supremacists, which is listed as the number one terrorist group in the U.S. today.  
I am against the harsh treatment of immigrants. Both sets of my great grandparents came from other countries to escape starvation and dictatorships. America is made up of immigrants.  
I am against giving everyone a gun who wants one. There need to be universal background checks to protect us.  
I am against 200,000-plus people dying from a virus that could have been contained long ago if protocols were followed.  
I am against punishing peaceful protestors.  
I am against taking away Obamacare and putting 21 million Americans at risk, with no health insurance plan. We are still dealing with COVID-19.  
I am against lowering pollution standards and causing substantial harm to our environment. I am against withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and the World Health Organization.  
No candidate can 100% do what we want, but one candidate is addressing more of these problems than the other. I am going to take a stand and support the oppressed and victimized people that are struggling in the U.S. right now.  
Rev. Al Sharpton and Pastor Doug Pagitt wrote an article for Time Magazine titled, "Why White Christians Should Vote Against Trump in 2020."  
Some Christians are ignoring Trump's "shortcomings" and are focusing on the abortion issue, but at what cost? They seem to think it is okay to use him to get what they want and ignore all the other problems that are going on.  
These problems will continue to get worse. Biden said we are fighting to save the soul of this nation. I agree.  
Christian friends are saying that God is working through Trump. Well, just think of all God can do through Biden. Nothing is impossible with God.  
I ask you to pray and think about how much good you can do with your one vote, how many people's lives you can affect and improve upon, and how you can help your neighbors.  
Abortion is not the only important issue here. There is a lot more at stake. To the Editor: 
The upcoming election is not a one-issue situation. There is a great deal at stake. Our democracy for one.  
I am against abortion and would love for abortion on demand to end, but there are several other problems that can't be ignored. I am against racism and white supremacists, which is listed as the number one terrorist group in the U.S. today.  
I am against the harsh treatment of immigrants. Both sets of my great grandparents came from other countries to escape starvation and dictatorships. America is made up of immigrants.  
I am against giving everyone a gun who wants one. There need to be universal background checks to protect us.

Many political ads of current circulation go far beyond the exaggerations of their predecessors. Formerly, generally speaking, most assaults upon a candidate's character were built from a negative interpretation of a factual event.  
For instance, an office-seeker might have been branded soft on crime by an opponent, if it was revealed, he, 30 years earlier, supported parole, not jail, for a 90-year-old found guilty of stealing lollipops.  
Today, a harsher assessment might be leveled, perhaps an accusation of controlling interest in a "geezergang" or harboring hatred of law enforcement.  
A segment of those who devise negative ads favor including in them a photograph of their target, original or doctored, if it implies the candidate is ugly, wicked, dippy, or bewildered.  
The content of certain ads is so composed of imagination, that they seem more appropriate for comic books than political literature.  
High on the list of these is a glossy flyer, having, in the upper right corner, a smiling picture of China's president, his hands applauding as he appears to look approvingly at Amy Kennedy seated at the lower left.  
In truth, his appreciation is not being directed at her, but at companies that left the U.S. before her birth, government officials who signed China favoring trade agreements when she was too young to vote, and federal administrations, every one of them who, despite frown and gripe, perpetuated those agreements, during years she devoted herself to advancing education.

Bob Jackson would make an excellent committee person for Middle Township. I have known Bob for several years. He has compassion, empathy, along with the attributes of high ethics and morality. Politics needs a strong dose of those qualities today. 
He would keep a lid on taxes, while also completing projects that benefit residents in a cost-effective manner. Bob would consider all views and make an effort to accommodate citizens who need help.  
He would treat township employees with respect and dignity. He would reduce wasteful spending and improve our township. He has a proven track record. 
On the freeholder front, my vote goes to Brendan Sciarra and Liz Casey. As a retired county employee, I experienced nepotism and favoritism. I observed wasteful spending, including $15 million of upgrades into a decrepit jail, only to be demolished a new jail built. It is time for new freeholders with fresh, bold visions who will provide checks and balances. 
Citizens need Sciarra and Casey. They are the only candidates who have pledged to eliminate nepotism and favoritism, along with employee advancement based on merit and not “connections.” Property taxes will be reduced by eliminating wasteful tax spending. It's time to live within our means. 
Jeff Van Drew has done a great job. He has always returned my phone calls and responded to my letters regarding policy reforms. We have discussed workplace issues, public pension reform, and a pending crisis of 400,000 New Jersey tenant evictions. 
The Veterans Administration (VA) granted my mother an aide and attendance pension after suffering a debilitating stroke. Payments were denied by misinterpreting documents. My lawyer proved the VA wrong. Two years of delays ensued after the VA agreed to reinstate the pension. Van Drew started a congressional inquiry. In a month, the money was sent to support her needs. Mom died a month later. 
Van Drew is responsive to all constituents in his district, regardless of party affiliation, and holds South Jersey's conservative views close to his heart. To his credit, he did not let the Democrat Party bosses intimidate him.  
President Trump has his flaws, as we all do. I'm a little disappointed with his first debate performance. Let's hope future debates are more professional and worthy of his high office.  
Trump returned jobs to America. He made tough trade deals that benefit our country. Europe now reimburses our nation for military defense. If reelected, he will stop the riots and random violence that plaques, ahem, the other party's cities. 
He has my vote. I pray all citizens will vote. It is only our democracy at stake. To the Editor:

After watching the recent, worst debate ever, I found I was disappointed in the moderator. There was no debate control.  
Here’s my solution and some new rules for debates. The moderator needs a tool for debate rules enforcement. 
I propose we follow soccer rules and have yellow and red cards on hand to be “awarded” by the moderator. If a candidate uses up their allowable time and continues after the warning, they get a yellow card.  
The same rule would apply to anyone who rudely interrupts another without being recognized. If one earns two yellow cards, the next penalty is the issuance of a red card.  
A red card comes with a 10-minute loss of speaking time supported by the offender’s mic disabled for the 10 minutes. One more yellow card being issued results in removal from the debate stage. To the Editor:

Do you remember a time when someone knew what they were doing when they purposely conned you? Lying to you was on the agenda. Getting you to do something that was not best for you was the priority. It wasn’t fair or right, but it was still done.  
There was even the sense that others were experiencing some unbelievable satisfaction in your going down the wrong road, with no brakes to keep you safe. 
You might think of a time when they were deceived by a family member, so-called boyfriend or girlfriend, spouse, or business partner that proved to be someone other than who you thought they were. They were acting a part that did not match the conviction in their heart. As you reminisce, it is still hard to fathom how someone who claimed to care could be so cruel.  
Living with that deception is still almost more than you can bear to think about. You weren't raised to believe this was the way to treat someone. It certainly was not something you learned in Sunday School. 
Have you ever been burned by outright lies with a purchase? Just because it happens all the time doesn’t take away the sting from the victim's soul that went through this ordeal.  
Sometimes, people get cheated out of a few bucks, and sometimes you buy something you think is genuine, only to learn later that it is a knockoff. You cannot buy a Rolex for $5, and you should not expect to receive something for nothing, especially when cheap comes wrapped in expensive packaging. There are no “great deals” when you attempt to sell your soul for rip-offs in return. 
There will always be wolves disguised as sheep. Flesh parading behind Jesus' face does not transform darkness into instant light. 
Unfortunately, too many deeds of deception are done in places where devotion to Jesus is expected. This is the worst counterfeiting practiced on our planet.  
Preachers appearing on television promise health and wealth if you invest your last few dollars to finance their million-dollar mansions built by the sea. Jesus didn’t have a roof over His head, and yet His servants are living high on the hog. There is something rotten in Denmark, and it isn’t kosher by heaven’s standards. 
Deception can break your heart, mind and bank, but spiritual tomfoolery can crush your soul. A hypocritical pastor, an abusive church, a legalistic maniac, or phony friend can cause long-term psychological, spiritual damage. Such toxic deception has opened the door to atheism.  
I have always tried to challenge those burned by this Bible thumping practice to not blame Jesus because some of His so-called disciples are deeply disturbed. If you are going to walk away from the Lord, make sure it is the real deal before you book a ticket out of dodge. Of all the knockoffs living among us are the painful peddlers who pawn a watered-down Gospel that has no promising news.  
Just because some belief systems receive the majority of the crowd’s approval on television and radio, in bookstores and media outlets, and even behind pulpits and in classrooms of well-respected churches and Christian institutions, none of that makes it the truth. If you want to know God's authentic word, be sure to have the one and only God of the word inside you. 
An impostor is a person who practices deception under an assumed character, identity or name. Ferdinand Waldo Demara Jr. was a prison warden, monk, lawyer, sheriff’s deputy, cancer researcher, teacher, religiously oriented psychologist, Baptist minister, and surgeon. In reality, he was none of those because he had a fascinating photographic memory that fueled his ability as “The Great Imposter.”  
Demara, born in Massachusetts, faked his way through life. His most famous exploit was masquerading as Surgeon Joseph Cyr aboard the HMCS Cayuga, a Royal Canadian Navy destroyer used in the Korean War.  
Throughout his time as a surgeon on the Cayuga, Demara performed many surgeries, including those on 16 injured soldiers. He would disappear to his room with a textbook on general surgery and proceed to speed-read the operation he was to perform, including major heart surgery. Amazingly, none of these patients died, and ironically, it was Demara's skill as a surgeon that exposed him. 
According to this article, a bullet removal from one wounded man made the papers, and when the real Dr. Joseph Cyr's mother read that her son, who operated a civilian practice, was now in the war, she proceeded to contact him, only to be assured by him that he was indeed not in the armed forces. She immediately contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and Demara was exposed for the fraud that he was.  
What was hidden in his closet was exposed in the light. Deceivers hate to be exposed. 
Unfortunately, masks are not only popular in pandemics. Our soul's enemy loves to portray himself as something he isn’t.  
The devil has a prime advantage because nobody believes in him anymore, which works in hell’s favor. He is the master of illusion and an expert in deception.  
The influence of darkness has turned angels into demons, kings into animals, pastors into predators, and sheep into wolves. It can swagger with self-importance one minute before writhing in self-contempt the next. Lies have hats that can be worn for almost every occasion, and Christians have no business putting this nonsense into their heads and hearts. 
Growing up, I watched a game show on television called “To Tell the Truth.” The program's premise was that three people claimed to be a person, and the panel's job was to ask questions to determine who was truthful about his or her identity. There would almost always be someone who was fooled by a feeling and duped by deception.  
This is no time to be taking those chances when it comes to knowing Jesus. God did not play hide and seek with us. He invites every man and woman to enter a relationship with Him. Our eternal destiny narrows to the reality of whether we know Him or not.  
Many claim to be experts about Jesus, but if it doesn’t match the One we can read about in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, it isn’t Him.  
This is no game, and is instead a matter of life and death. Jesus will tell many on that day who claimed to do wonders in His Name to depart from Him because He never knew them. Salvation has nothing to do with what we know but is everything with who we know.  
Jesus claimed to be the Way, Truth and Life and has made Himself available to everyone. Will you make a stand with your heart and assure you are not being fooled by cheap imitations?  
There is nothing phony about God’s love for you. There is no fine print, just eternal grace for all who willingly follow Him.

ED. NOTE: The author is the senior pastor of The Lighthouse Church, 1248 Route 9 South, Court House. On Tuesday, October 8, the Herald editorial team and some of the Cape Issues team members held our annual meeting with our congressman, Jeff Van Drew, following a tradition of many years of doing so.  
Why do we meet? He wants to understand what are our primary concerns, and we desire to solicit his advice and the use of his bully pulpit and his engagement to drive forward the items which we believe to be of benefit for our county.
Included in his explanation of the state of things in our nation’s capital, was an item which he said has not been reported in the media, that 50 to 60 of the Congressmen and Congresswomen vote via proxy, without being present. He finds that disturbing because it does not afford the interaction with other members to discuss the issues prior to voting. How are they to come to an understanding of various points of view on an issue without that interchange? I ask the question, can that be a small part of the problem with the dysfunction of Congress? 
After Congressman Van Drew spoke, and prior to the Q & A, I had an opportunity to summarize for the Congressman some of the primary topics we at the Herald and Cape Issues have been grappling with. Below, I will focus on infrastructure and education. 
If we desire to return to a thriving and balanced community as a county, people must be able to easily come and go from our county. This is truer now than ever before. With the advent of Covid, we are seeing numbers of people and families deciding to remain here after the traditional close of the summer season. It is fair to guess that most of these people retain their bonds with their employment and schools elsewhere, and can do so via the internet.  
Is that likely to become the new normal post-Covid? From an economic development perspective, we certainly hope so. To the degree that people can live here and work elsewhere, our economy will benefit via their engagement and spending.  But these people retain significant attachments to their other community; if we facilitate that ongoing attachment via modern roads in and out of Cape May County, we will foster their ability and desire to remain, at least a portion of the year. To the degree that we require some of them to drive the winding and unsafe roads laid out three-quarters of a century ago, we will impede that desire to remain.  
As we all know, we live in a beautiful, highly desirable county, which others would also like to enjoy year-round. If we want that, we need to do our best to achieve it. In improving our roads, we would not only be encouraging economic development, we would be making our county safer for evacuation in times of severe storms. 
One of the ladies present stated, however, that none of her friends desire to see modern roads built, referring to the completion of Route 55. That is understandable; modern roads bring more people; if one likes things as they are, he doesn’t want to see crowds.  But we are losing population, and many of those being pushed out are our youth who cannot afford homes here; thus, the increasing age of our population. This is a sticky wicket, but we must find a balance.  
ANOTHER issue is our bridges; originally built with federal money, we now need federal and state dollars to help us replace or rebuild them. 
AND FINALLY, I brought up the challenge the education of our youth. We are now slated to lose millions of dollars in state aid to Cape May County schools. This necessitates rethinking how we educate our children, to find a way to do an ever-better job with less money.  
Any congressman has a very limited ability to address any given issue, but non-partisan discussions like this work to move the process forward.

Any congressman has a very limited ability to address any given issue, but non-partisan discussions like this work to move the process forward. Nancy wept on the phone during her therapy with me.  
“I am so scared. Ned insists on bringing our grown daughter into our house when she visits next week with her new husband, but I know they are really casual in managing the virus, and Ned and I are in the age range that jeopardizes us. My heart condition makes things worse.  
“I just do not know how to convince my husband that our health dictates our instincts to welcome our grown kids into an area we have worked hard to protect from the virus. I even have masks to match my outfits. Can you help?” 
My heart went out to Nancy. My husband, John, and I maintain social distancing with our kids and grandkids, as hard as that is. We do not want to look back and say, “We should have."  
One of my favorites of my 44 cousins died of the virus, at 94, in a well-run nursing home, in the affluent Philadelphia suburbs. In the dozen years this column appears twice monthly, appreciative comments from readers affirm that we need to band together to make life work.  
At 5 a.m. Oct. 2, I made my gigunda cup of blackberry tea and checked the news. We are 31 days away from choosing our next president, and Donald and Melania Trump both tested positive for the coronavirus. For my clients who are already worried, this news will increase their anxiety.  
The world feels frightening because it isn't safe. Each of us must fight to win this battle, but how do we strengthen our mental health in the face of a global disaster? 
Cape May County has suffered less than many communities but has treated more than 1,000 cases. Last month, I suggested that each of us maximize our health by finding a quiet place to breathe deeply and remind ourselves that we are safe. It's needed but insufficient in terms of the anxiety my clients express, but "better safe than sorry" is wise. 
Because we must take action, I reviewed the classic book "Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy," by Dr. David Burns. He provides steps to remain psychologically strong amid the threat to our physical and mental health. 
Three active steps lower anxiety without medication: 
1. We become anxious when we interpret an event through the prism of our inner worries. We create an inner dialogue and distort the events by feeling worried or fearful. 
2. Burns lists 10 ‘cognitive distortions,’ such as all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, disqualifying the positive, jumping to conclusions, and labeling ourselves. If you perceive an event as negative, you create distorted thoughts, therefore creating unpleasant emotions and increasing anxiety. Teletherapy can teach easy coping methods without medication, but you must get lessons from an expert. 
3. Below are practical strategies for dealing with these cognitive distortions: 
a. Start being mindful enough to catch negative thoughts and write them down. Do not let them buzz around your head. 
b. Precisely learn how you are twisting ideas and blowing them out of proportion. 
c. Substitute a more-objective thought that counters the one that made you look down on yourself. If a thought says you are not good at doing anything, catch it, write it down, then write a logical, more realistic counter thought to it.  
Try discovering the logical reasons that convey you are good at something, no matter what the thought says, so instead of weighing you down, your thoughts will start boosting your mood naturally. 
Your emotions are created by thoughts, not events. Read the Burns book, or listen to an audio version. It is fun and easy to understand.  
Review your cognitive distortions and decide how to intervene, or call a therapist and get expert help. You will need to fix those distortions by writing them and replacing them with more realistic logical thoughts, which, of course, you can do. 
To Consider: Invest time to help your brain re-wire itself towards better coping mechanisms, which can become second nature. Is it worth it? Nothing could be timelier than pushing yourself to gain control over pandemic anxiety.

“I am so scared. Ned insists on bringing our grown daughter into our house when she visits next week with her new husband, but I know they are really casual in managing the virus, and Ned and I are in the age range that jeopardizes us. My heart condition makes things worse.  
“I just do not know how to convince my husband that our health dictates our instincts to welcome our grown kids into an area we have worked hard to protect from the virus. I even have masks to match my outfits. Can you help?” 
My heart went out to Nancy. My husband, John, and I maintain social distancing with our kids and grandkids, as hard as that is. We do not want to look back and say, “We should have."

The divisiveness in this nation is palpable, even for those who employ what I like to refer to as “The Ostrich” - keeping your head in the sand while avoiding all news outlets.  
Because of the current climate, I have kept my political affiliation to myself and plan to share it when I cast my vote Nov. 3.  
It doesn't offend my sensibilities, though, when I drive past homes displaying political signage declaring undying loyalty for the other party. Everyone is entitled to have their own opinions. That is the beauty of diversity.  
It offends me, however, when I drive past a small business displaying political signage. Multiple signs. A small business where I have been a loyal customer for years, where I have spent my hard-earned money, which helped keep that small business afloat.  
To say that I was furious at seeing this is an understatement. In declaring their political affiliation, this small business has forever alienated me, and has lost my business.  
Yes, I asked myself if my reaction and response would have been the same if our political affiliation was in alignment. The answer is no.  
This is even more reason to keep politics out of your place of business, as it will invariably alienate someone.To the Editor:

Last week, I fell and broke my hip. Thank you to the gentle Stone Harbor police and EMTs who carefully lifted me and comforted me on the way to the hospital. 
I spent four nights in Cape Regional Medical Center. The first two nights in the emergency room, I heard those constantly in-demand doctors and nurses react with speed, efficiency, professionalism, and kindness. I heard an end-of-life situation where everyone on the team performed every possible life-saving measure while respecting the dignity of their patient.  
My assigned surgeon, Dr. Susan Harding, a University of Pennsylvania trauma surgeon, was recognized by Philadelphia Magazine as a “top doctor.” She asked Dr. Stanley Michael, another outstanding Penn trauma surgeon, to join her in performing my total hip replacement. I couldn’t have asked for better, world-class surgeons. 
The physician’s assistants, physical therapists, nurses, aides, pharmacy, dietary, and sanitation staff were, without exception, skilled, selfless, helpful, and compassionate, using positive reinforcement to meet my every need, all day and all night, post-surgery. 
Each Cape Regional employee that I met contributed to alleviating my pain and making my stay not only tolerable but pleasant. 
Thank you to everyone at Cape Regional. Because you seem to love your job, and do it so well, we, the patients, feel better quicker and are reassured knowing such an outstanding institution is nearby should we every need it. To the Editor:

The media's sole purpose is to mock the president. They don't check the facts of the story, just repeat what everyone else is saying.  
They want a viral moment. They hate him so much that the more aggressive, meaner, and nastier they can be, the better.  
The left loves it. They are relentless in condemning him.  
I'm tired of all the negative. He cares about our nation and the American people. To the Editor:

Sorry to sound like a broken record (I realized that half of the readers don't know what a broken record sounds like), but, again, I must criticize the county for their seeming total disregard for the time their citizens and voters have to spend on Avalon Boulevard due to bridgework. 
I also wouldn't be writing to the editor if county officials bothered to respond to my email questions, but they never seem to care enough to do so. 
Knowing the extraordinary number of people still here this year, the bridge job should have been delayed for a month. Anyone paying attention or caring about our time in transit would have realized this. 
Any time the bridge needs to be totally closed, the roads leading to Avalon Boulevard should be blocked to prevent giant backups, again, a simple courtesy we're not seeing. 
The green/red lights should be monitored and timed to measure traffic and adjust for times of heavier in-and-out traffic, not just five minutes each way all the time. 
This and all future contracts requiring lane closures should require around the clock, everyday work to get them done faster and more efficiently. Yes, that is more expensive, but how much are we wasting in fuel and employees on the clock sitting in traffic doing nothing? 
No, I am not an engineer, but I have lots of experience in administering public contracts. I don't claim to represent anyone, but I've heard numerous complaints that echo my sentiments. 
A little common sense, better planning, and a real concern for the people of Cape May County by the freeholders and other county officials would be greatly appreciated. 
As always, I am happy to discuss this issue with any county officials, publicly or privately. To the Editor:

Jeff Van Drew and his Republican Party are promoting the argument in front of the Supreme Court Nov. 10 that the preexisting clause that keeps your children on your health plan until they are 26, and Medicaid expansion, must be eliminated.
Why are Van Drew and the Republicans supporting this craziness?
Simple. Donald Trump told them to do it.
Imagine not having health care because you have diabetes. Imagine your children being thrown off your health plan when they become 19.
It is going to happen because people like Van Drew are letting Trump do it.
There are many things we, as citizens, can't control. One thing we can control is how we vote.
Do not allow Van Drew and his party to take away your health care. Send a message and vote to protect your health care.To the Editor:

I grew up in the '50s and '60s, in Niles, Illinois. My grandparents on my mother's side were Republican, while my Dad was a Democrat, and my mother was a Republican.  
It seemed like back then it didn't matter what political party you agreed with. You all got along.  
In fact, Congress argued during the day, at work, and then went out together at night, leaving their differences at the office, I was told.  
Every night, on the news, it talked about the Vietnam War. I don't remember them saying it was a Democratic or Republican war, rather an American war. 
Today, it seems like the nation is getting deeply divided. We have Maxine Waters telling Americans to get in the face of Republicans who are doing their jobs.  
You have Nancy Pelosi wanting to send money from the relief package to her friends, not to mention defunding the police.  
The Democrats want open borders and to get rid of ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement). In Chicago, near where I grew up, you have over 50 shootings over a weekend. More people are being shot in Chicago than in the military service overseas. 
Fires are being set, cars are being overturned, and windows are being broken all over the nation. Protests for Black Lives Matter continue. What happened to this nation?  
When I went to grade school, we had the Pledge of Allegiance followed by the national anthem and a prayer. They took away prayer. Did they take away the Pledge of Allegiance and national anthem, too? 
I think where this nation started to go wrong was to take God out of our schools. We now are taking Him out of our lives and want everything given to us.  
Let's work together, not tear each other apart. Respect each other and try to see what your neighbors and friends are going through.  
In 2016, I didn't vote for Hillary Clinton, even though she grew up in the suburbs of Chicago at the same time that I did. I voted for Trump, even though I didn't like what was being said. I might have voted for Vice President Biden if he ran, in 2016. 
I just wish the Democrats would work with the president and the news would let the American people know what President Trump has actually accomplished. The Democrats moved too far left, with the Green New Deal, plus Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's far-left ideas. 
I am not telling anyone who to vote for. I suggest voting for the person and party that closely resembles the Bible and what it says. We, as a nation, have to turn back to God. To the Editor:

I've owned or rented on Seven Mile Island for 65-plus years and have enough wonderful memories to fill a book. Another book could be written about the cherished landmarks that have fallen over time, and Smuggler's Cove will undoubtedly join the list.  
During the same time span, I find it curious that no attempts were made to designate special sites as historical landmarks, or to seek Open Space funding. Aside from 81st Street, Stone Harbor, in particular, provides very little access to the bay.  
When Smuggler's Cove is gone, there will be nowhere in town for a vacationing family to rent a boat or buy bait and tackle or fuel. It's hard to believe.  
A quick browse of the local real estate listings includes $10 million homes that are paying $26,000 in taxes. Does Stone Harbor's leadership really think those owners will disappear if they need to pay more to preserve the town's history and charm?   
Some cite progress, but when Hahn's, Henny's, the Shelter Haven, "The Nun's Beach," and Smuggler's Cove fall, "The Seashore at Its Best" loses something. To the Editor:

The thought of Amy Kennedy being characterized as an elitist is completely laughable. Those of us who are lucky enough to know Amy know that this is the furthest from the truth. For those who don’t know her personally, spending five minutes with her would change your mind.  
Amy is the daughter of two local schoolteachers. She dreamed of being a teacher herself, as a child, and would eventually make her dream come true by working in the public school system for over 10 years.  
Amy continues to champion causes that she cares deeply about - mental health and education. Even with all the hubbub surrounding the Kennedy last name, she remains a South Jersey resident, committed to raising her family here and helping people. She remains steadfastly Amy.   
While Jeff Van Drew is trying to convince you that Amy is an elitist, he’s making his staged personal appearances in his fancy designer suits with his famous four-point white pocket square.  
Amy’s running around all of the Second Congressional District, getting to really know the people, and listening to them, with her whole family in tow, dressing like the person she’s always been - a teacher and an advocate. To the Editor:

There is much talk about the security and integrity of mail-in ballots for the Nov. 3 election. Concerns over tampering and improper handling have been raised.  
Recently, the Cape May City clerk held a random drawing for ballot slot positions for city offices and submitted the names and ballot questions in a certain order to the Cape May County clerk.  
The county clerk decided to arrange the slot orders differently. Some of the candidates unsuccessfully challenged the actions of the county clerk and the injunction ordering a delay in ballot mailing was lifted.  
The Press of Atlantic City reported, “Ballots for other municipalities in Cape May County are already in the mail, County Clerk (Rita) Fulginiti said on Wednesday (Sept. 23) after the hearing. Without an injunction, she expects to send out the 2,100 Cape May ballots right away. 
“'I’ve got them in my car,' she said late Wednesday. 'I’m planning to put them in the mail (Thursday).'” 
I feel no need to comment further. I think that about says it all about the integrity of the electoral process and the degree of deference given to ballot security here south of the Tuckahoe.  
God grant that the process is different in other parts of our republic.  To the Editor:

God grant that the process is different in other parts of our republic.  A Denver magazine reports a disastrous fire in the city during which a large warehouse, containing tons of ice, was destroyed.  
The editor points out that the building actually contained thousands of gallons of a potent extinguisher, but it was frozen. What an eerie picture of the apathetic condition of many of our local churches today. While sin runs rampant throughout the country, fiery faith has become ice cold. 
There is a biblical word describing the rebellion to the truth happening even in places of worship. 
First, God has been banished from society and social life, and now, there is a movement to even have Him evicted from churches. Our English word “apostasy” describes the widespread departure from the faith that will occur in the days leading to Jesus' return. 
Congregants will desire only positive, upbeat messages from their pulpits. Topics like sin, hell, salvation and judgment will be deemed “hate speech” and prohibited from being preached to the masses. Any mention of Jesus' blood will be outlawed as offensive, and only state-approved sermons will be given the go-ahead. 
If you think this philosophy is far-fetched, one only needs to study the German Evangelical Church amid Hitler’s reign. 
We are living in an age where a sense of doom is looming. We feel terrorism's threat invading even our local neighborhoods. We have all experienced the effects of diseases like COVID and the pandemic that has stolen any normalcy in 2020.  
Politics has become volatile as hatred is spewed between parties. There is the ever-present economic insecurity. We hear of devastating earthquakes and tsunamis, and overhead, even the climate is threatening our existence.  
Add to these the ever-quickening pace of our nation's moral decline, the defunding of law and order, and it all begins feeling like the prelude to something, dare I say, worse on the horizon. It’s almost like one big shoe is about to drop, and indeed it is. 
We have heard the saying, "Waiting for the other shoe to drop." This modern idiom traces its origins to the way tenements in larger cities were and built, in the late 1800s, often with bedrooms stacked atop one another. It was common to hear the neighbor above you take of his or her shoes at night and drop them to the floor; first one, then the other.  
"Waiting for the other shoe to drop" is to "await a seemingly inevitable event, especially one that is not desirable." The Bible says that at a time of great turmoil, while the world is groping for peace and security, "destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape" (1 Thessalonians 5:3). The Bible also says, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring the good news to those who need it.”  
I’m not ready to take my shoes off yet. It’s time to live like we are citizens of heaven. This world is not our real home; we are only passing through.  
For too long, God’s people have tried playing both sides, attempting to serve two masters when only one can be placated. As Joshua proclaimed years ago, “Choose this day whom you will serve.”  
Yes, following Jesus may cost you popularity and position, but the alternative will never satisfy the yearning for eternal love and belonging that is in everyone’s soul. Maybe, we need to learn how to wait for the best so we don’t sell out for the temporary quick fix. As long as I have life, I want to lace up my Nikes - which, by the way, means “victory” in the original Greek language - and run the pace of the race in introducing Jesus' love to every face I see until I finally gaze upon my Lord in person. 
The enemy loves getting us to doubt that the One, who is the truth, will set us free, and also to live in an alternative universe where we think that we know better than God in deciding the direction to take. The enemy also wants us to forever forfeit for some immediate thrills.  
Jesus clearly said that He is the Way, Truth and Life. Maybe, rather than settling for a religion, we should seek a real relationship with the One who created us. You must know the One who made you because He knows you and is inviting you to find your forever in Him. 
I am startled that we haven’t acted like we have learned anything from history. When I see mob mentality, it only causes my soul to grieve.  
God is calling us to experience His perfect love that ousts fear. Intimidation, manipulation, bullying and name-calling, labeling, and lying can’t lead to paradise. It never has and never will, so I refuse to wait for the other shoe to drop.  
Keep those who claim to know Jesus with their running shoes on. God has called us to a race that is not so much about finishing first as much as it is about finishing well.  
Some people want to live somewhere perfect and peaceful. God is preparing that place for us, but it is not here, so while I am here, I want to bring Him honor and glory by showing others Jesus.  
He is the true treasure and Lord we must follow. This shoe is not dropping until I am finished breathing. How about you? 
ED. NOTE: The author is the senior pastor of The Lighthouse Church, 1248 Route 9 South, Court House. A Denver magazine reports a disastrous fire in the city during which a large warehouse, containing tons of ice, was destroyed.  
The editor points out that the building actually contained thousands of gallons of a potent extinguisher, but it was frozen. What an eerie picture of the apathetic condition of many of our local churches today. While sin runs rampant throughout the country, fiery faith has become ice cold. 
There is a biblical word describing the rebellion to the truth happening even in places of worship. 
First, God has been banished from society and social life, and now, there is a movement to even have Him evicted from churches. Our English word “apostasy” describes the widespread departure from the faith that will occur in the days leading to Jesus' return. 
Congregants will desire only positive, upbeat messages from their pulpits. Topics like sin, hell, salvation and judgment will be deemed “hate speech” and prohibited from being preached to the masses. Any mention of Jesus' blood will be outlawed as offensive, and only state-approved sermons will be given the go-ahead. 
If you think this philosophy is far-fetched, one only needs to study the German Evangelical Church amid Hitler’s reign. 
We are living in an age where a sense of doom is looming. We feel terrorism's threat invading even our local neighborhoods. We have all experienced the effects of diseases like COVID and the pandemic that has stolen any normalcy in 2020.  
Politics has become volatile as hatred is spewed between parties. There is the ever-present economic insecurity. We hear of devastating earthquakes and tsunamis, and overhead, even the climate is threatening our existence.  
Add to these the ever-quickening pace of our nation's moral decline, the defunding of law and order, and it all begins feeling like the prelude to something, dare I say, worse on the horizon. It’s almost like one big shoe is about to drop, and indeed it is. 
We have heard the saying, "Waiting for the other shoe to drop." This modern idiom traces its origins to the way tenements in larger cities were and built, in the late 1800s, often with bedrooms stacked atop one another. It was common to hear the neighbor above you take of his or her shoes at night and drop them to the floor; first one, then the other.  
"Waiting for the other shoe to drop" is to "await a seemingly inevitable event, especially one that is not desirable." The Bible says that at a time of great turmoil, while the world is groping for peace and security, "destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape" (1 Thessalonians 5:3). The Bible also says, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring the good news to those who need it.”  
I’m not ready to take my shoes off yet. It’s time to live like we are citizens of heaven. This world is not our real home; we are only passing through.  
For too long, God’s people have tried playing both sides, attempting to serve two masters when only one can be placated. As Joshua proclaimed years ago, “Choose this day whom you will serve.”  
Yes, following Jesus may cost you popularity and position, but the alternative will never satisfy the yearning for eternal love and belonging that is in everyone’s soul. Maybe, we need to learn how to wait for the best so we don’t sell out for the temporary quick fix. As long as I have life, I want to lace up my Nikes - which, by the way, means “victory” in the original Greek language - and run the pace of the race in introducing Jesus' love to every face I see until I finally gaze upon my Lord in person. 
The enemy loves getting us to doubt that the One, who is the truth, will set us free, and also to live in an alternative universe where we think that we know better than God in deciding the direction to take. The enemy also wants us to forever forfeit for some immediate thrills.  
Jesus clearly said that He is the Way, Truth and Life. Maybe, rather than settling for a religion, we should seek a real relationship with the One who created us. You must know the One who made you because He knows you and is inviting you to find your forever in Him. 
I am startled that we haven’t acted like we have learned anything from history. When I see mob mentality, it only causes my soul to grieve.

There seem to be some suspicions regarding the reporting of the death of teachers in the southern school districts. Because of the sensitivity of the reporting of these deaths, America is not getting the full picture regarding the opening of schools with in-class and in-person instruction.  
The southern school districts, as a whole, have opened schools with in-person instruction in mid-August, disregarding all advice by medical authorities and simple common sense.  
The result, as you can imagine, is multiple infections of both students and staff, that continue to rage. They seem to be looking for ‘herd immunity’ and couldn't care less who dies in the search. 
The availability of fully state-certified teachers with a degree and experience is very low on a good day.  
When there is a good chance of a teacher being infected with a deadly disease, the chance of finding a licensed teacher with proper certifications and degrees is zero.  
Nobody wants to work facing likely death or at least painful, debilitating illness. It simply is not worth the risk, especially in the very low-paying southern states.  
It’s even very doubtful in the higher paying north. In New Jersey, there are school systems that can’t attract educators because of current conditions.  
Herds of currently employed educators have opted to take a leave of absence or retire, rather than risk dying. I’ve been pointing this out for months. The writing was on the wall, so to speak. 
I worked in the inner-city for 38 years where the population seems to be targeted by this virus. The statistics regarding racial background becoming infected is far higher for this population. As a result, educators are very careful regarding their exposure to this virus. 
Children have become targets for this disease if they’re members of a family that has little or no background in everyday health practices. Because of this, you can be sure that this virus will enter the classroom.  
This is why the larger cities have decided to go to totally remote instruction. The risk of infecting the entire professional team is so great, that this is the only current answer and response we have until there’s a vaccine that is proven to work. To the Editor:

I have been trying for three months to receive my unemployment compensation and am owed over $9,000. I am sure there are many more in the same boat.  
The state Department of Labor will not answer their phone, as the message says the voice mailbox has not been set up. After spending hours, days, and weeks trying to get through, I am told that they have to contact a “specialist” group that nobody can contact, and this group does not have to answer to anybody.  
Although I verify every week, I was told the problem is that there was an error in my voice certification. The only thing is I don’t certify by voice, only the computer.  
They haven’t addressed this problem for three months and there is nobody to address this issue to. I have contacted the governor's office but just got a form letter saying to go onto the Department of Labor website, but nobody to contact or speak to.  
I have contacted the First District legislator. All I am told is that there is nothing they can do except for me to wait my turn.  
I have been waiting for three months. The state doesn’t realize the burden they have put people into. I have no money, no job, and have bill collectors calling every day. They don’t want to hear about having to wait.  
The Department of Labor and Gov. Murphy should be ashamed as to how we are being treated, and this is such a government mess.  
I would declare personal bankruptcy but have no money to pay a bankruptcy lawyer. They have had six months to figure this out and I don’t buy the COVID-19 excuses anymore.  
I am so frustrated and there is no place to turn to. There is no Department of Labor or local unemployment offices to go to.  
If, by chance, after spending hours, days, and weeks trying to get through on the phone, the agents just say they will send a form to the secret “specialists” that nobody can speak to and they can’t get a reply.  
I think there is a big story here that needs to be fully explored and exposed, as it is effectively destroying people’s lives. To the Editor:

For those who like to keep their sanity and ignore or pay very little attention to our local politics, I truly understand your reasoning; for many years, I felt the same way.  
You may think that your vote won't change anything because those career politicians just keep doing what they do and I have no power to change anything. It's that attitude that the career politicians rely on.  
It was in roughly 2014, after wanting to see what the local politics was about, that I found out that our local governments and, in particular, the county freeholder board, is really controlled by a minority of people who, because of a lack of participation, determine how our taxpayer dollars are spent and/or raised.  
From what I've seen, it's disturbing how cavalier many, not all, of these politicians are with dealing with our tax dollars and even with the employees in which they oversee. 
I would like to hopefully change the minds of those potential voters by saying that your vote will count this year if you vote for Brendan Sciarra and Liz Casey for freeholder. It will bring a voice that will call for positive change to policies negatively affecting the employees at the county and the Sheriff's Office.  
I know they will stand up in public and challenge the career politicians on their frivolous spending habits and misguided treatment of the county employees, making county government transparent.To the Editor:

If you, citizens of Cape May County, love your home and genuinely want the best for it, you must vote selfishly. You must vote in a manner with our county's best interest at heart.  
Do not look at the election like you would a football game. Do not back a candidate because “that’s always been your team.” Your team is Cape May County. 
How does team Cape May County exist? It is a tourist-based community. People visit us for our beaches and our beautiful towns. Anyone who would seek to take that from us is our enemy.  
Cape May is also kept afloat by the many people who retire here, bringing additional year-round jobs. Health care, retail, and accommodations are our primary job sources.  
Located on our peaceful peninsula, we are too far away from any ports or transportation hubs to draw industry, we don’t have the population to support becoming a tech hub, and as the oceans continue to warm, more and more fishing is gone further north. 
Sadly, the possibility of oil drilling off our shores and the shores of our neighboring states has become a frightening reality. Southern states have a temporary two-year moratorium on drilling, but there is nothing to stop it north of South Carolina.  
If oil is discovered and drilling takes place, we are not situated in an area where we would benefit economically from this. We would only suffer from the marred views and inevitable oil spills.  
Yes, this happens rather frequently. The spills are not always massive, but according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), there were 137 oil spills in the U.S. alone, in 2018, and the odds of this happening are even greater on the East Coast, as these would be the first experimental drills in an area that has not been regularly drilled before. 
Our other biggest source of revenue is also under attack. Retirees of all walks of life depend on Social Security in some form. It is often their primary source of income and even when it is not, it is usually the only secure source, as pensions have become rare or collapse and 401Ks (if you are lucky enough to have one) are subject to the constant fluctuations of the markets.  
The payroll tax that covers 90% of Social Security funding has been deferred with promises to make the deferment permanent. The plan to cover the lost revenue by printing more money from the general fund is the first step to dismantling it.  
Only Congress can eliminate Social Security, but it is being set up to fail. Congress also would have to approve up to an additional $1 trillion a year as Social Security stands to pay for it that way.  
Budgets are barely passed without getting down to the wire. Would you want your primary source of revenue to be up to Congress? 
Either one of these events will severely cripple Cape May County, but together they will kill it. We need our representatives to pledge “undying support” to our interests, not to outsiders who seek to destroy us.

Tim Donohue is railing over his perception of personal attacks. In reality, there are some among us revealing things Tim may not share with all his constituents. 
Is it attacking to inform voters, outside of being mayor, Tim has been a full-time, paid bureaucrat since late 2015? He is in his fifth year toward a public employee retirement that will cost taxpayers for many years to come.  
Is it an attack to point out these things appear to have been facilitated through his brother, Michael Donohue, then County Republican Chairman? Shortly afterward, Michael was appointed to his now-defunct judgeship.  
In the same timeframe Mike's judgeship concluded, Tim's lucrative county appointment had a dubious ending, as well. Tim was then put on the payroll of Sen. Testa. 
Mike, again, seized control of the party and got hired as county administrator, with an outrageous salary of $14,500 monthly. These guys have found their way into the taxpayers' pockets big time. It's not attacking to reveal these truths in any and every way possible. 
As for Tim, we're fortunate to have Bob Jackson, an excellent candidate who is well respected throughout the community. Bob's interest is to serve the taxpayers, not bleed them to death. He has no need, nor desire for public employment.  
Mike isn't that simple. He is clever and has total control of his party and our county.  
Fortunately, we have two credentialed candidates, Liz Casey and Brendan Sciarra, for the freeholder board. They can bring checks and balances to this dysfunctional panel that has handed the reins to the Donohues.  
I am not attacking anyone. I am advising everyone of this serious issue confronting our community. 
Amy Kennedy is very important for our congressional representative. Van Drew was playing footsie with these guys, even as a Democrat.  
While I do not know all the candidates, I do know I will be voting against any part of this unscrupulous political machine. You need to know if a candidate in your district is connected to these opportunists and vote against them.

These guys are passing taxpayer money around through nepotism and lawsuits, as though it was their own.I know if you only mention the word “abortion,” like it or not, you have lit a stick of dynamite.  
If someone desires to polarize a room into two passionate camps of strong feelings and cries of emotional angst, mention Roe vs. Wade. 
I remember being in grade school when the term defining the procedure to terminate a pregnancy entered mainstream American language. The words of a dear sister who was my teacher, at Notre Dame Catholic School, still ring in my ears.  
She said, “The word causes raised eyebrows now, but one day, it won’t even evoke an individual to bat an eyelash.” Though she would have rather been wrong, she turned out to be right. 
I’m a pastor who doesn’t believe in abortion because I am pro-life. My understanding of the Scriptures shows me that life begins at the moment of conception. While we were still in our mother's womb, the Bible explains that God had specific plans for our lives.  
John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Spirit while Elizabeth carried him inside of her. God called Jeremiah to be a prophet since his conception.  
A baby is not a fetus or, worse yet, just an "it." A baby is a miracle, and even if the pregnancy happened in less than perfect circumstances, it doesn’t mean that the product of that union was a mistake.  
Every life is a gift. Even the lives of precious children who never saw the light of day on earth, each one is waiting for us in God’s presence. 
Terri and I would have nine children today if they had all lived. Before our son, Rudy, was born, in 1986, we endured two miscarriages, in 1983 and 1984. I say "we" because though, as a man, I didn’t have the honor of carrying those children inside my body, they will forever hold a place in my heart.  
After Rudy, Leah and Abbie were born, in 1986, 1988 and 1991, respectfully, tragedy would, once again, rear its ugly head, in 1995 and 1999, when our sons, Nicholas and Benjamin, would only survive a short time on earth.  
Though Nicholas was with us for only 90 minutes, we spent a lifetime in an hour and a half, and when it was apparent that déjà vu was occurring with our son, Benjamin, Terri and I wondered if we would ever recover from excruciating heartache. Their lives' length didn’t change the power of the impact to us. There are still moments when I believe my heart will explode because we miss them profusely. 
When Terri learned she was pregnant again, in 2002, medical professionals thought we were crazy. I remember my wife and I sitting in a conference with a doctor, at Cape Regional, as he soberly and seriously rationalized the reasons we should be responsible and terminate the pregnancy, saving ourselves from the harsh reality that because of our history, chances for a healthy birth were a million to one.  
I know now why many choose abortion. The tension during the meeting with that physician was so thick, it would have taken a chain saw to cut through, but we knew that there was no way we could take matters into our hands.  
I visited our local hospital's chapel and poured my heart to God. Joel Thomas Sheptock was born July 30, 2003, I was 43 and Terri was 41, but we had another son to raise. He's currently 17, a senior at Cape May Tech, and I couldn’t imagine our lives without him. 
Still, more tragedy loomed.  
A ninth child was born too early, in June 2005, and our oldest son, Rudy, was graduating from Middle Township High School that day, as another Sheptock child was ushered directly into God's presence. I remember someone saying to me, “Are you still going to stay a minister? I mean, look at how many kids you have lost.”  
I replied with tear-stained eyes, “It is my faith in God that gives these children purpose. Because I believe God is who He says He is, I will see them all again.” 
Every life matters. I grew up in a family where my parents had seven children and adopted 30 more. Many of my brothers and sisters became Sheptocks because nobody wanted them.  
My siblings include people society labels as severely handicapped. The Sheptock family is made of kids with no arms, one arm, cerebral palsy, learning disorders, and two wonderful brothers with Down syndrome.  
Martin and Issac exhibit more love coming through their pinkies than some so-called healthy people display in their entire body. No one can convince me or either of them that their lives don’t matter.  
I can’t imagine how this world would be if they weren't born. If you ask any of my siblings if they wanted to continue living, I know they would all give you an exuberant "yes."  
These people aren't accidents. God loves and has a plan for each. 
I do not picket abortion clinics and scream hate towards women who have had abortions. I don't desire to be known as a Christian by just what I am against.  
I am for all life and fight for each one until God says it is time to take that person home. I don’t believe that you are suddenly an "it" inside the womb, and that only after your journey down the birth canal you are a human being.  
I felt prompted to write about this topic because somebody reading this might be confused and overwhelmed by the predicament they are in. God loves you and is a God of grace and new beginnings.  
I want to speak up for the unborn. If all mankind is created equal, these babies are just that, fearfully and wonderfully made by God.  
I close with some lyrics from an old Phil Keaggy song: “Who will speak up for the little ones, helpless and half-abandoned? They have a right to choose life they don’t want to lose. I’ve got to speak out, won’t you?”  
The World Health Organization estimated that, in 2018, between 40 and 50 million abortions were performed. I write this article in honor of each life that never got the right to see the light of day. Please, choose life.

Terri and I would have nine children today if they had all lived. Before our son, Rudy, was born, in 1986, we endured two miscarriages, in 1983 and 1984. I say "we" because though, as a man, I didn’t have the honor of carrying those children inside my body, they will forever hold a place in my heart.  
After Rudy, Leah and Abbie were born, in 1986, 1988 and 1991, respectfully, tragedy would, once again, rear its ugly head, in 1995 and 1999, when our sons, Nicholas and Benjamin, would only survive a short time on earth.  
Though Nicholas was with us for only 90 minutes, we spent a lifetime in an hour and a half, and when it was apparent that déjà vu was occurring with our son, Benjamin, Terri and I wondered if we would ever recover from excruciating heartache. Their lives' length didn’t change the power of the impact to us. There are still moments when I believe my heart will explode because we miss them profusely. 
When Terri learned she was pregnant again, in 2002, medical professionals thought we were crazy. I remember my wife and I sitting in a conference with a doctor, at Cape Regional, as he soberly and seriously rationalized the reasons we should be responsible and terminate the pregnancy, saving ourselves from the harsh reality that because of our history, chances for a healthy birth were a million to one.  
I know now why many choose abortion. The tension during the meeting with that physician was so thick, it would have taken a chain saw to cut through, but we knew that there was no way we could take matters into our hands.  
I visited our local hospital's chapel and poured my heart to God. Joel Thomas Sheptock was born July 30, 2003, I was 43 and Terri was 41, but we had another son to raise. He's currently 17, a senior at Cape May Tech, and I couldn’t imagine our lives without him. 
Still, more tragedy loomed.  
A ninth child was born too early, in June 2005, and our oldest son, Rudy, was graduating from Middle Township High School that day, as another Sheptock child was ushered directly into God's presence. I remember someone saying to me, “Are you still going to stay a minister? I mean, look at how many kids you have lost.”  
I replied with tear-stained eyes, “It is my faith in God that gives these children purpose. Because I believe God is who He says He is, I will see them all again.” 
Every life matters. I grew up in a family where my parents had seven children and adopted 30 more. Many of my brothers and sisters became Sheptocks because nobody wanted them.  
My siblings include people society labels as severely handicapped. The Sheptock family is made of kids with no arms, one arm, cerebral palsy, learning disorders, and two wonderful brothers with Down syndrome.  
Martin and Issac exhibit more love coming through their pinkies than some so-called healthy people display in their entire body. No one can convince me or either of them that their lives don’t matter.  
I can’t imagine how this world would be if they weren't born. If you ask any of my siblings if they wanted to continue living, I know they would all give you an exuberant "yes."  
These people aren't accidents. God loves and has a plan for each. 
I do not picket abortion clinics and scream hate towards women who have had abortions. I don't desire to be known as a Christian by just what I am against.  
I am for all life and fight for each one until God says it is time to take that person home. I don’t believe that you are suddenly an "it" inside the womb, and that only after your journey down the birth canal you are a human being.  
I felt prompted to write about this topic because somebody reading this might be confused and overwhelmed by the predicament they are in. God loves you and is a God of grace and new beginnings.  
I want to speak up for the unborn. If all mankind is created equal, these babies are just that, fearfully and wonderfully made by God.  
I close with some lyrics from an old Phil Keaggy song: “Who will speak up for the little ones, helpless and half-abandoned? They have a right to choose life they don’t want to lose. I’ve got to speak out, won’t you?”  
The World Health Organization estimated that, in 2018, between 40 and 50 million abortions were performed. I write this article in honor of each life that never got the right to see the light of day. Please, choose life.

Decisions like these separate optimists and pessimists. The optimist sees possibilities in the problems, and the pessimist sees problems in the possibilities. One sees open doors to opportunities, and the other sees only the size of the obstacles in the way, but as Christians, we should be known more for our faith than our fear. When you process the coming days through heaven's eyes, the greatest pitfalls can become a great potential for blessings. 
Whether we like it or not, outlook determines the outcome. If we concentrate only upon the doom and gloom, we are destined to become discouraged and behave as if we have already been defeated, but if we fix our eyes upon Jesus, perhaps we will witness the Lord turning graves into gardens and transforming trash into lasting treasures. Looking through the eyes of love certainly influences how we will tackle today and tomorrow. 
When we read the Scriptures, do we truly believe that God can do what He did then in our day?  
God took Moses’ blunders, and after a 40-year hiatus in the back wilderness, it made him one of the Bible’s greatest leaders. Jesus took Peter’s cowardice and the inability to complete a simple sentence to a slave girl and turned him into the most powerful preacher to deliver a sermon. The same God that took us broken and battered sinners and transformed us into His beloved and blameless people is still looking to work His miracles today.  
God can take any of us, no matter how bruised we may be, and make something wonderful for his glory. Our attitude towards what the Lord does today will influence what story unfolds around us tomorrow. 
Stop looking at what you don’t have and instead see the Lord. Stop listening to all we can’t do and let’s get busy with what God is waiting for us to accomplish now.  
God always starts with what we have before giving us what's needed. Are you willing to lay your abilities down so God can, within us, raise the muster needed to slay the giants that blaspheme our faith? Without faith, it is impossible to recognize the movements of the Almighty.  
Rather than try to impress Jesus with our resume, He would be more pleased if we would surrender our hearts to Him. Heroes are born not out of charismatic personalities, but out of simple men and women who choose to not stay stagnant. I am not a pawn on the chessboard of chance. I am a child under the influence of an awesome God. 
If you trust Jesus as your savior, you have everything required to bring light into the darkness. Instead of whining, why not start with an attitude of worship?  
God inhabits the praises of His people, and when we get a clear view of Him, the other challenges don’t seem as daunting as they did when we attempted to walk this adventure solo. Man’s agenda is to look to this world to satisfy a thirst it is unable to quench.  
God’s will for us is to find all that we lack in our relationship with Jesus. Whenever we prioritize being happy over the Lord making us holy, we aim for a prize that is no reward. If God is not the one who will greet you after this race, you are running along the wrong road.  
Anything less than eternity is passing away. We must not forfeit the crown of glory that God promises for those willing to wait upon the Lord because we impatiently choose to settle for the cheaper carnival trinkets currently available. 
The God of today is the way of the quick fix. When we need to know something, we want instant access to information. When we’re hungry, we settle for fast food. When pain hits, we want immediate relief, no matter what it costs.  
When wrongs occur, we want swift justice. When trying new things, we want immediate success. When starting a new job, we don’t want to begin in the mailroom. We want to go right to the top of the ladder, and when God does something we don’t understand, we want to know why. 
If God is a worthy deity, we figure He won’t dilly-dally, especially when we need Him, but the Lord is not the one on trial. We will never grow in faith unless we constantly pursue Jesus. If God doesn’t have a free hand to construct a masterpiece from our mess, we are selling our faith short. 
What are you singing today, and do you have a song at all? Have this year's events caused the church to lose its voice? I don’t think so.  
I believe that the remnants of Jesus' real followers will continue singing songs of praise, even in the setting of prison walls. Our song is not one that celebrates our circumstances. The inspiration of the tunes we croon comes from the Holy Spirit residing inside of us wherever we are.  
Sing it loud and live your faith boldly. The old Coke commercial used to say, “I’d like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony.”  
Today’s church should be teaching the watching world that our praise songs are not funeral dirges, but symphonies of hope. This is no time to sing the blues. Today is the day to raise the praise.  
God is everything He claims to be, and one day, He will rid this world of sin, evil, death and pain. While we wait, God allows these factors to continue, and our precious promise is that God uses pain and problems to draw His children back to Himself.  
I know that being in His arms is the safest place, even in the middle of a hurricane. Where are you today?

ED. NOTE: The author is the senior pastor of The Lighthouse Church, 1248 Route 9 South, Court House. Lately, I've been wondering how there can be so many conflicting opinions coming from “Christians” during this election year. The arguments are tiring, discouraging, and downright perplexing. 
As Christians, we are citizens of heaven, but that doesn’t negate our responsibility to our civic duty as earth's inhabitants. However, as sojourners, we should operate solely under a biblical worldview.  
We are commanded to be "salt" and "light" to the culture around us. We are expected to know biblical truth, and, without question, it is our responsibility to vote. 
As a Christian, how do I decided who to elect? Should I pick the lesser of two evils? Am I looking for a Christian to lead? Does character count?  
It’s simpler than that - biblical truth matters, and as such, a Christian should choose platform policies over people and personalities. Can we at least agree that the evaluation of a person’s character is a complex process based on various factors? Speaking as a pastor, I remind you that hidden sins are just as culpable as those nasty outer ones. 
Evaluating from the objective over the subjective is crucial.  
As Christ's followers, we should ask, "What does the platform say about abortion?" What are the educational initiatives aimed at our youth, and do they affirm the LGBTQ curriculum? Do the policies support Israel?  
Which is the fastest way to get blessed (or cursed) by God, according to the Bible (Genesis 12:2)? Does the platform support faith-based initiatives, school choice, and support for the military and police? Does your party of choice support "Black Lives Matter," whose organizational “what we believe” page is anti-authority, anti-cisgender, anti-father, and anti-nuclear family?  
Whose co-founders are trained Marxists? By the way, the lives of all Black people matter, but sadly, the organization doesn’t even espouse that in its actions and responses.  
To be clear, they are anti-black in the womb, anti-black wearing blue, and anti-any black that says the narrative isn’t true. 
It is baffling that these essential, non-negotiable biblical issues can be downplayed and overlooked, and instead, many who wear the name of Christian remain fixated and blinded by hate for a leader - which, by the way, is unbiblical.  
Actions speak louder than words, therefore it would be best to evaluate someone’s actions over their words. For example, if you thought someone was racist, you should see if their policies support that type of hate. I must add, too, that if you are a Christian and get your information solely from the godless mainstream media, you need to make a U-turn and seek Christian leaders, starting with Jesus and the Bible. 
As a Christian, I am compelled to evaluate my culture's spiritual temperature, and it doesn’t take much acumen to see we are closer to a socialist agenda becoming our governing framework. Ask the many churches, in California, that are being threatened with fines, arrest, and property loss. 
Another question to evaluate is, "Which party leaders espouse socialism? 
Socialism always rolls over to Communism - ask China and Cuba how that worked. Also, consider how that would restrict your freedom, as a Christian, to share the gospel. 
I am a Christian voter, not a single-issue one. If a party’s platform is anti-Christian, pushing out all mention of God, anti-life, called pro-choice, anti-Israel, called diplomacy, anti-police, called reforming society, anti-morality, called human rights, anti-guns, called “saving a life," and affirms all forms of sexuality, as well as transgenderism, which not only goes against biology but biblical theology, the choice is clear. 
America is at a precipice between freedom and socialism. Are you seeing the fruit in our culture that is emanating from the root? If not, you must pray for spiritual "eyes" to see what lurks beneath the surface and vote accordingly. My faith votes biblical.

ED. NOTE: Maher is the teaching pastor at Coastal Christian Ocean City and is president of Soldiers For Faith Ministries. Social Media and website: @TruthOverTrend. This Sept. 11 made me think about saving patriotism. 
The idea crossed my mind while working to prepare another newspaper. The day wasn't too different, socially distant from others, with an occasional joke, loud laughs, and teeming keyboard clicks circulating the Herald's office. 
Being loyal to our nation has, in my recent recollection, never been discussed and debated as frequently. From giving the “Star-Spangled Banner” a knee to making ornaments of political flags, folks are questioning their counterparts' fidelity to the U.S. 
Practicing patriotism today calls for stone-hard proof, showing American to be American, ensuring folks have Old Glory on hand at all times, almost like a driver's license to prove their validity. If it’s not present, it's, as a sociologist would say, an informal sanction, a fine to shame someone without hurting their wallet. 
In that proof is the belief that one's daily routine should consist of piledriving social media extravaganzas and political protests. Skipping one would, unfortunately, not be worthy of a true American. 
I'm young, with a lengthy life ahead and various places and people to see, but I've yet to see so many doubt others' loyalty to our land of the free, one nation under God. It's as though society is attempting to ween out the slackers, doubters, and downright wrongdoers.  
I don't recall being patriotic having a rulebook. That seems to be changing given today's political environment and our nation's ongoing debates over the pandemic, social injustice, the economy, and others. 
Patriotism doesn't, and should never, show partisanship. It doesn't survive brutal conditions and exposure to colors that are allowed to divide Americans. It's something universal mankind experiences daily but of which lacks awareness. 
Being patriotic doesn't require loading a house with a store's worth of American flags or require Trump and Biden-themed boats meandering the back bays. It also doesn’t merit shunning those who are still timid about accepting a movement like Black Lives Matter into society. 
Showing love for America is about developing constructive ways to assist the community, like volunteering. Buying lunch locally or shopping from a mom-and-pop shop is also a pleasant addition to the prideful goodie bag everyone metaphorically carries. Most importantly, it’s about treating others with respect instead of letting a Wawa door close in front of someone because, politically, they don't align. 
American patriotism is traveling a path to a Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe-type story, one where those who love its original form fight to rescue it, only to have lifesaving acts falter under negativity until it fades. It's supposed to make Americans happy, not miserable by having the belief be that true loyalty is found in cluttered partisan messages. 
If there's anything of which Sept. 11 should have reminded folks besides the people who succumbed to the worst act of terrorism in history, it's that patriotism is an allegiance not to our country, but one another. Supporting others, loved ones and strangers, is what preserves the American way. With that, pledges to others vehemently pledges love to the nation. 
Hopefully, it won't take until Sept. 11, 2021, to finally make our allegiance's true form become reality.

ED. NOTE: The author is the editorial assistant at the Cape May County Herald. To contact Conklin, email econklin@cmcherald.com. We have all faced the problem. Situations on the roadways where it is not clear what state law requires of those sharing the road. These are times when a pedestrian, a bicyclist and a driver all have some doubt about who can do what when.  
I was reminded of this dilemma last week on a short ride through the streets of North Wildwood. Within the span of five minutes I was part of two potentially dangerous situations. 
In one a woman crossing the road on her bicycle expected me to stop as though she were a pedestrian. In the other an actual pedestrian crossed against the light, motioning to me that he had the right-of-way.  
Of course, the only course of action in any situation is to do what is most likely to result in the safety of all concerned.  That is what happened in these two instances. Yet a better understanding of the rules might reduce the number of times we all have to make those judgments. 
It has been almost a decade since New Jersey’s crosswalk law went into effect. Ten years later we still see behavior that suggests the law is not fully understood. Add to the mix a steady increase in the number of bicyclists on the roadways, many of whom appear to equate themselves with pedestrians, and the confusion increases. 
Some general principles make the rules of the road easier to understand.  
Under the current law drivers must stop for pedestrians in designated crosswalks. The old law required drivers to yield to pedestrians in marked crosswalks.  
Crosswalks may be signalized or have no signals. If signals exist, the signals must be obeyed by pedestrians and drivers. The man walking against the light did not have the right to be in the crosswalk despite his belief to the contrary. 
It is also important to know what constitutes a crosswalk. Crosswalks may be marked or unmarked. Marked crosswalks may be at locations other than intersections. In New Jersey all intersections are legal crosswalks whether they are marked or not.  
It is also critical to know that pedestrians and bicyclists are not the same and the rules for them are not the same. 
The law gives pedestrians special rights in crosswalks, but those rights come with obligations. 
Pedestrians must obey available signals at crosswalks and do not have the right to cross when the signal is giving drivers the right of way. Pedestrians not at a crosswalk must yield the right of way to all vehicles.  
Pedestrians are also required to use sidewalks when available or walk on the left side of the road when sidewalks are unavailable.  
Bicyclists must adhere to the same rules of the road as drivers. This means that bicyclists must obey all traffic signals and signs, must use turn signals and must travel on the right side of the road.  
 State law does not ban bicycles on sidewalks or boardwalks, but many municipal ordinances do.  Where bicycles are allowed to use the sidewalks, the bicyclist must yield to pedestrians. 
 Bicyclists may travel no more than two abreast and that only when it does not impede traffic. Otherwise bicyclists should be in single file.  
 In Cape May County bicyclists may also have the benefit of on-street bicycle lanes which provide exclusive space on the road, but they do not remove the requirement for bicyclists to obey the same rules of the road as drivers. 
The crosswalk law remains confusing to many. There have been attempts to change it.  
In 2017 a group of South Jersey legislators proposed a bill dubbed the Driver and Pedestrian Mutual Responsibility Act.  The bill would have limited pedestrians to crossing at crosswalks.  It also would have removed the responsibility for a driver to come to a complete stop in such situations. Rather the driver would have been required to yield. The bill failed. 
Of course the current laws are in place with good intentions. The goal is to reduce the number of fatalities involving bicyclists and pedestrians. It is fair to ask how well the laws are working. 
Two years ago a report from the Governors Highway Safety Association showed the number of pedestrian fatalities has increased steadily in the last decade. With other traffic deaths decreasing, the percentage of pedestrian deaths as a proportion of all motor vehicle deaths is growing alarmingly.  
The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) also reports that last year the number of bicyclist deaths in roadway accidents increased 6% over the prior year.  
Here in New Jersey for the year in 2009, the year before the new rules went into effect, State Police statistics show that 28% of roadway fatalities involved pedestrians or bicyclists.  
In 2018 and 2019, the same statistics through September 17 show 32% of the fatalities involved pedestrians and bicyclists.  For the same period of 2020, the number continued to move up to 35%. 
This is not a problem of inexperienced children. USDOT says that the average age of pedestrians and cyclists killed in traffic crashes is 46 years old, with one fifth of pedestrians and one third of bicyclists struck at intersections.   
Certainly drivers, pedestrians and bicyclists are all responsible for knowing road use laws. Yet we daily see evidence that many do not.  
It may also be time for a focused campaign to educate those of us who share the roadways on the rights and responsibilities of all concerned. More importantly it may be time to rethink the laws that give an illusion of rights to pedestrians that do not in fact exist. We have all faced the problem. Situations on the roadways where it is not clear what state law requires of those sharing the road. These are times when a pedestrian, a bicyclist and a driver all have some doubt about who can do what when.  
I was reminded of this dilemma last week on a short ride through the streets of North Wildwood. Within the span of five minutes I was part of two potentially dangerous situations. 
In one a woman crossing the road on her bicycle expected me to stop as though she were a pedestrian. In the other an actual pedestrian crossed against the light, motioning to me that he had the right-of-way.  
Of course, the only course of action in any situation is to do what is most likely to result in the safety of all concerned.  That is what happened in these two instances. Yet a better understanding of the rules might reduce the number of times we all have to make those judgments. 
It has been almost a decade since New Jersey’s crosswalk law went into effect. Ten years later we still see behavior that suggests the law is not fully understood. Add to the mix a steady increase in the number of bicyclists on the roadways, many of whom appear to equate themselves with pedestrians, and the confusion increases. 
Some general principles make the rules of the road easier to understand.  
Under the current law drivers must stop for pedestrians in designated crosswalks. The old law required drivers to yield to pedestrians in marked crosswalks.  
Crosswalks may be signalized or have no signals. If signals exist, the signals must be obeyed by pedestrians and drivers. The man walking against the light did not have the right to be in the crosswalk despite his belief to the contrary. 
It is also important to know what constitutes a crosswalk. Crosswalks may be marked or unmarked. Marked crosswalks may be at locations other than intersections. In New Jersey all intersections are legal crosswalks whether they are marked or not.  
It is also critical to know that pedestrians and bicyclists are not the same and the rules for them are not the same. 
The law gives pedestrians special rights in crosswalks, but those rights come with obligations. 
Pedestrians must obey available signals at crosswalks and do not have the right to cross when the signal is giving drivers the right of way. Pedestrians not at a crosswalk must yield the right of way to all vehicles.  
Pedestrians are also required to use sidewalks when available or walk on the left side of the road when sidewalks are unavailable.  
Bicyclists must adhere to the same rules of the road as drivers. This means that bicyclists must obey all traffic signals and signs, must use turn signals and must travel on the right side of the road.  
 State law does not ban bicycles on sidewalks or boardwalks, but many municipal ordinances do.  Where bicycles are allowed to use the sidewalks, the bicyclist must yield to pedestrians. 
 Bicyclists may travel no more than two abreast and that only when it does not impede traffic. Otherwise bicyclists should be in single file.  
 In Cape May County bicyclists may also have the benefit of on-street bicycle lanes which provide exclusive space on the road, but they do not remove the requirement for bicyclists to obey the same rules of the road as drivers. 
The crosswalk law remains confusing to many. There have been attempts to change it.

The entire political situation and, indeed, the entire nation seem to be headed on an unusual or frightening path, depending on your level of paranoia.  
It is commonplace to speak of the deepening division between Republicans and Democrats, but the division is due to much more profound causes than politics. 
A couple of weeks ago, Trump claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was dominated by a “deep state” who was out to ensure that Biden won. 
A Trump-appointed spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, with no medical background, claimed that the CDC was guilty of “sedition” for correcting Trump’s statements about COVID-19. 
Of course, there were the flat out lies about COVID-19 being a hoax, which were believed by his supporters despite scientific evidence to the contrary. Let’s not forget Trump’s supporters' claims about climate change - “It’ll get cooler, you watch.” 
The interesting thing is that most Republicans are silent on all this; they seem to believe in, or at least support, the conspiracy theories. They have certainly not spoken out against the Qanon conspiracy theories about liberals supporting child trafficking, devil-worshipping, and the like. 
It is getting so bad that for the first time in its 175-year history, internationally respected Scientific American had to make a political endorsement - in favor of Joe Biden - due to Trump’s “well-documented rejection of science, from climate change to the coronavirus, which has cost tens of thousands of Americans their lives.” 
What it boils down to is who to believe: people with no scientific or medical background and have never worked in any scientific field, or endeavor, or the people who invented 4G internet speeds, landed exploratory vehicles on Mars, and developed life-prolonging cancer treatments.  
A majority of Republicans claim, without scientific backgrounds, to know who is right. 
Not all Republicans are climate deniers, but almost all the climate deniers are Republicans; ditto with believers in conspiracy theories. 
This is the true division - most Republicans reject the science and scientists while emphasizing acceptance and belief while most Democrats accept the conclusions and recommendations of science emphasizing facts, education, and critical thinking. 
This is not merely in medicine and climate change. Most Republicans believe that the economy does better under Republican presidents than under Democratic presidents, yet economists have pointed out that precisely the opposite has been true for the last 100 years.  
In fact, Trump’s alma mater, the Wharton School, concluded that Biden’s economic plan will lead to more growth than Trump’s, although, the study remarked, that it is hard to compare the two plans because Trump hasn’t made sufficient proposals to make a conclusion. 
They are only a couple of the major differences that separate left and right, Democrats and Republicans, today but they are profound ones. The point is that it isn’t so much a matter of politics that divides us; it is more a mindset, critical thinking, and education. To the Editor:
